Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,1040.com review (and why I went back to FreeTaxUSA),"IDK if this will end up being helpful to anyone, it may save you an hour or two though. Just my experience with 2 [mostly] excellent tax filing sites for 2023 - 1040[.]com and FreeTaxUSA

The IRS site recommended 1040[.]com to me, and offered free State filing (the ever elusive turnkey Fed+State free+free solution that isn't a PDF from your state's website).

YMMV - for NY Taxes, at the end of the road it told me that NY forms weren't ready - I gather this means their forms, because I submitted everything otherwise needed - FreeTaxUSA said all was OK (and that went well last year). From what I can gather, they can't actually process NY Sate Taxes on this day. I will wait for a few weeks (mid Feb maybe) to see if they get it together, otherwise I will proceed with FreeTaxUSA's $16 total.

FreeTaxUSA, if you filed last year, took maybe 30min to complete - admittedly after having just run through the 1.5h 1040.com, re-familiarizing myself with the gotchas after a year of not thinking about tax things. FreeTaxUSA also has a W2 PDF Import feature, which was nice, but only saves maybe 10-15mins (I only found a single error, an errant extra item in box 14 of ""I"" with $0, which would make no material difference - meaning it was materially accurate, but not 100% perfect)

For 1040[.]com, I had a mathematical error, where it calculated my Fed Owed amount as damn near my AGI. I reached out to Live Chat Support, and within minutes the issue was solved - either their system mis-truncated my decimal, or I missed the decimal key (most likely), listing my income as being 100x higher than what it was (IDK why I still enter decimals, they're always rounded to nearst $). The Agent also gave me a couple of basic recommendations on a couple of other fields I filled out, which he noticed while looking over my forms to figure out what happened. Nothing major, but it was cool that he took the extra care.

I wanted to say that I was really happy with the quick response from Support from 1040[.]com, and overall it was pretty smooth given it was my 1st encounter with them (so extra entries) and the manual W2 filling. The questions they asked throughout were clear, the ""?"" buttons had good, concise info, and their site has zero advertisements and flare/fluff - just a basic website in a good way. Think good ole web 1.0 with a web 2.0 feel to it. For taxes, this was a great change of pace. (note: I use an adblocker, so IDK if they have Banner Ads, but it wouldn't block the ""SuperPro+ Audit Hero Expert"" upsell, so none of that nonsense.

Had it not been for the failed State portion, I would be raving about 1040[.]com this year. Again, YMMV - they support something like 20 states for free, NY being one of them allegedly, so it's possible your state is supported/complete. The experience was so good that I'm not even upset about that 1.5h I spent - just wanted to note it in case you're not looking to risk that time.

In the end, I popped back over to FreeTaxUSA, which has Free Fed, and $16 (with tax) State. I used them last year and it went smoothly. This year went faster. The total they calculated was exactly what 1040[.]com calculated.

I've submitted neither - I have to wait for a possible form from Vanguard, which isn't due for a couple weeks, so I might as well check with 1040[.]com afterwards to see if NY is happier, and maybe I can save that $16.

At any rate, FreeTaxUSA is as solid as always - though they did insert ~3 upsells this year. I don't remember that last year, but I could be wrong there. Not a deal-breaker, I still get the ""honest"" feel from their approach (they advertize the State fee upfront, not at the end, which is more than can be said for some of their competitors). Also their webapp ran very smoothly with near-instant page-loads/transitions.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Update to my pro-rata mistake. Rollover IRA realization has delayed me a bit and I still haven't filed my 2023 taxes (I'm due a refund and I did file an ext but obv that was for 10/15..,"Original title was describing how I'm doing a backdoor Roth IRA (but made the mistake of doing the conversion in October 2023 while only just remembering in Oct 2024 that I have a relatively small $4700 Rollover IRA sitting at Fidelity...so I wanted to know how to proceed with next steps but added now that I haven't submitted my 2023 return yet and because that's not submitted/finalized wanted to see exactly how I should enter things to account for and manage my pro-rata mistake. Where and exactly how do I (and should I) account for my $4700 Rollover IRA in Fidelity?

According to what I've learned on White Coat Investor (quite a good backdoor Roth walkthrough), I should have turned that rollover IRA into a Roth IRA before Dec 31st of 2023. Some data points, these aren't meant to be in any particular order, but I have numbered them to make referencing them easier for the kind folks on here as they help

1. I haven't filed my 2023 taxes, I'm in the middle of it in TurboTax but I stopped to read more about pro-rata once I realized the fidelity rollover IRA would count as part of my total IRA. I'm going to be getting a federal and state refund as I usually do.
2. I **contributed** $6000 to a Vanguard traditional IRA money market fund in April 2023 (for 2022 tax year) and then October of 2023 is when I did my **conversion** to the Roth IRA for that 6k, but looks like I was supposed to have checked to see if I had any rollover IRAs (and SEPs, etc) so that I could get rid of them by Dec 31st of 2023, but I didn't do this as I had forgotten I only had 1 and it was at fidelity while the rest of my funds are with Vanguard.
3. My spouse (who is the sole earner) does not have any rollover IRA, SEP, etc IRAs (only IRA they have is the 6000,6500,and7000 contributions to 1 traditional IRA money market fund in Vanguard which will eventually be used for conversion to backdoor Roth)
4. I don't work anymore, and my spouse who is the breadwinner doesn't have any traditional IRAs like a rollover, SEP, etc. I do the taxes using turbotax and I haven't ever done my spouse's **conversion** yet. I have only done 1 conversion, and it was only for the $6k 2022 contribution amount. I still have the 2023 and 2024 ($6500 and $7000) contributions sitting in the traditional IRA money market since when I made them in April 2024. Going forward I will try to be more timely in the contribution to conversion step, but for now my main concern is to enter things correctly in TurboTax so that I can handle my pro-rata mistake.

WCI's site says this about my situation:

""What If You Didn't Empty the IRA?

What if you screwed this one up? Your Backdoor Roth IRA conversion step just got pro-rata'd. There is a tax bill associated with that because most of your conversion was of tax-deferred money rather than post-tax money like it was supposed to be.

The fix for this is going to vary by the individual, but the easiest fix is to simply convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now, so you end up getting all your post-tax money into that Roth IRA. Another possible fix is to figure out a way to separate your basis in that IRA, roll the tax-deferred money into a 401(k), and then convert the basis left behind in the IRA.

Do yourself a favor and just empty the darn IRA by December 31. Keep in mind that this is usually not an instantaneous process, so don't put it off until you're on holiday break at the end of the year.""

I don't understand how to do what he (the author, Jim Dahle) is suggesting. ""The fix for this is going to vary by the individual, but the easiest fix is to simply convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now, so you end up getting all your post-tax money into that Roth IRA. Another possible fix is to figure out a way to separate your basis in that IRA, roll the tax-deferred money into a 401(k), and then convert the basis left behind in the IRA.""

I guess the easiest fix is to convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now according to the above. So, does that just mean that I call up Fidelity and convert the $4700 Rollover IRA to a Fidelity Roth IRA? And then what do I do? How do I correct things now that I made that pro-rata mistake? If I do nothing then I think I’m taxed extra for my pro-rata error, how can I minimize the damages for my mistake?

**As I'm in the middle of doing my 2023 taxes now, I have learned thanks to the fine folks on reddit that my 8606 for the 2022 tax year might be incorrect on line 6 ""Enter the value of all your traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs as of December 31, 2022, plus any outstanding rollovers.""**

So, some questions from this:

1. Should my $4700 Rollover IRA that sits in Fidelity have been written on line 6?
2. For my 2023 taxes do I include $4700 for my Fidelity Rollover IRA + the $6500 + $7500 that's in the Vanguard traditional IRA (the ones that are part of the contribution part of the backdoor, i.e. step 1, with step 2 being the conversion to Roth which I should do sooner rather than later, now that I'm understanding all of this much better). I thought that the 6500 and 7500 contributions don't get calculated towards the pro-rata rule, but clearly I'm still learning lol.
3. What is the step by step of what I should do regarding:

3A) 2022 Form 8606. What should I do about this? What would happen if I just left the 2022 Form 8606 as is and changed my Fidelity Rollover IRA to a Roth IRA next week or so?

3B) 2023 tax filing and how to report properly. Seems like I have 2 years of pro-rata because of having that Fidelity Rollover IRA existing in both 2022 and 2023, as in, only now in 2024 am I going to be calling Fidelity and having them change that Rollover IRA to a Roth IRA, and speaking of, is that the best thing to be doing with the Fidelity Rollover IRA considering it's a fairly small amount in this sort of context.

3C) Roth Conversion: How do I go ahead and report the conversion that I did last year of the 6k and how do I report the Roth conversions that I'll do in a few weeks for the $6500 and $7000 amounts (or I can do right now if you think that's best)

Thanks in advance to all of the wise minds in here!",2024-10-17 19:00:50,2.0,1.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,After tax contribution to trad IRA + Pro Rata rule question,"We are over the income limits of contributing pre-tax $ to IRAs. We each have traditional IRAs with >> $100K (from previous employers 401ks). This calendar year we contributed $7K each to (new, $0 value) traditional IRAs and immediately did a Roth conversion on these accounts for the full $7K. 

IIUC, we're now going to run afoul of pro rata rule if we don't fix this before the end of year.  
1. is that correct?   
2. are we totally in the clear tax-wise if we each roll over our traditional IRAs that have $ in them in to our 401ks? Both our companies have OK'd this.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Am I wrong to tell my tax pro to claim depreciation on my rental startup and improvements?,"I have a Single Family property and I built an ADU. I moved into the ADU and also did upgrades to the Main Home prior to renting it out. All in I spent about $250k.

It’s my understanding that upon sale there will be a mandatory rental depreciation recapture “up to 25%”. 

My long term plan for this property is to move out and rent the entire thing. However two or more years prior to a sale I would likely move back in and stop renting entirely. 

This would allow me to both fix up the home for sale and claim primary residence again, in order to get the $250k single / $500k married Capital gains tax credit.

Based on my plans, am I wrong to tell my tax pro to start depreciating the improvements now? And if my plans are to move back in would the depreciation recapture happen when I reclaim the entire thing as a primary residence, or would that not happen until sale?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Recommendations for a tax return review,"Hi all,

I've got what I think is a pretty standard return.  MFJ, W2 income, 2 kids, minimal investment income.

We traditionally have HR Block prepare and file our returns, but I feel like the pricing is getting out of control... last year it was close to $500 to prepare and file.

I just prepared our return for this year with FreeTaxUSA and it seemed pretty straight forward.... but I wouldn't mind having a pro take a 2nd look and maybe see if we're missing any deductions or credits.

Any services out there that would offer something like this without doing a full preparation and file?

Thanks in advance.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Help! What am I doing wrong?,"I am trying to expense my business assets (slide 1) which total $22,848, deducting their full value under section 179 (slide 2) but turbotax keep showing me a negative number $-18,500 (slide 3). I have no idea where that number came from. When I click and loot at each asset, it shows that my estimated expense for said asset is in fact its full value (slide 4).

I tried taking the 80% special depreciation for my office furniture expense (slide 5) to see if anything would change, and the full 80% was indeed deducted (slide 6) increasing it from $-18,500 to $-4,249 in total asset expenses (slide 7).

What am I doing wrong? Why isn’t it showing $22,848 in total asset expenses in the first place since I am trying to deduct all of it this year but rather a negative number? How did turbotax get that $-18,500?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,H&R Block charged me $575 and still didn’t understand the original issue,"I’ve been married for five years and we have always filed our taxes separately. We also make sacrifices to save extra money and put it into Roth IRA accounts each year. In March, thanks to trying to file with FreeTaxUSA for the first time, I discovered that if you are married filing separately, you can’t contribute to an IRA if you make more than $10000 a year. 


In five years of being married, between my former tax guy, the H&R Block tax preparation website and FreeTaxUSA, only the latter ever made this information known. Over the course of five years, we filed separately and thought we were doing everything just fine and no one ever said otherwise. 


In March/April 2024, the site to download my main job’s W2 got hacked for weeks and I had to file for an extension. I got an extension until October. We spent some time trying to figure out how to approach this issue and decided to see a professional in person. 


In September, we went to a physical H&R location to get my taxes filed but also get the former returns amended as “married filing jointly”. The guy that was there that Saturday named Alan seemed like he knew exactly what we were talking about and seemed really calm about it. We made an appointment with him to get the issues resolved. 


At the scheduled appointment we handed over our information and explained the situation. We discovered he didn’t understand the rule about Roth IRA contributions. A few days later, he sent an email saying it wouldn’t make sense to do any amendments and still didn’t seem to get the reasoning of why we wanted to amend. Either way, I knew I was running out of time until the October 15 deadline and he had all our documents so I let him just do my normal taxes.


Today, I went in to wrap things up. He started to review all of the deductions and everything. He didn’t even remember that I had worked one day in New Jersey in 2023 which made me have an extra W2 and owe NJ $1. I had to point that out because I wanted to make sure that I didn’t owe anyone anything. 


When everything was explained he said they were charging me $575. Mind you I don’t make a ton of money. But because of the different 1099s and W2’s I had from investments and a few side gigs, that’s what they charged me. I explained that when I did my taxes the last two years with the H&R site and opted for a professional to review them, I was charged about $200 each time. He said “well this time you had someone do your taxes for you.” 
Since it is October 12 I just bit the bullet and let them charge me $575 for something I could’ve done by myself for $200. I wound up getting a return of $200, owing $300 and being charged $575… He still didn’t even solve the main issue that I was looking to solve in the first place. It feels frustrating and I’m still worried about the original issue.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"Real Estate Accounting: Closing Costs, Cost Basis and Depreciation ","Does anyone know if closing costs should be proportioned out according to the land versus building breakdown when recording the settlement statement for book keeping?

Hypothetical scenario: Purchase of a property for $100,000. Closing costs are $10,000. Tax assessment has the land value at 50% and the building value at 50% ($50,000 for each in this example).

Do I:

A) allocate $5,000 of the closing costs to land and $5,000 to building? This would bring the depreciable building value to $55,000 (building value 50k + building closing costs 5k).

B) create a new fixed asset account called ""closing costs"" and add the $10,000 to this account and depreciate it over X (?) amount of time?

C) Allocate the full $10,000 in closing costs to the building so I can depreciate all the closing costs over the 27.5 years (39 for commercial).

D) something else?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,My Employer has not been taking taxes out of my payroll. ,"TLDR: Quick summary for anyone needing similar advice, it looks like I did this to myself. I put a 1 instead of a 0 on the new W4 and ended up claiming a dependent. Employer used an online form for me to fill this out. Learned my lesson and should read an actual w4 for the instructions. Thanks to the kind redditors that took time out of their Sat to help me out.

Back in late 2023 I noticed that my federal withholding was super low on my payroll.... as in only paying $6 a check. I asked my employer (very small company literally just me and my boss) about it and they reached out to their Payroll company, Surepayroll, to confirm. Surepayroll did confirm that everything looked right and that tax brackets had changed so I qualified for a lower withholding. Ok.... So I continued on thinking that everything was ok.  My checks continued to only have $6-$10 dollars taken out. I even confirmed another time this was ok. Yes everything is ok. When looking at the overall amount it never raised a red flag because typically $150-$200 would overall be taken out which has always been normal for me in previous jobs. Its just that the amount was thrown more into the FICA, social security and state tax sections. This has continued on. I even got a tax refund in Feb although I am a student and I know that I got a tax break for a few things. A few months have passed and I reviewed my paystubs (I know I should be doing that every single time but life had gotten crazy). Turns out I haven't gotten ANY money taken out for federal withholding for 4 MONTHS. April - Present.  No money taken out. Again the AMOUNT TOTAL is the same. About $100-200 depending on my hours worked. The months that I did pay? $1 or $2. What the heck do I do? I don't make much money and I wouldn't be able to afford to pay a huge lump sum in taxes in the next couple months. I emailed my boss and I haven't gotten a response.

What can I do at this point to protect myself or try to figure out what's going on? Is this even normal? Any advice would be helpful.

EDIT: My gross pay is usually about 28k. I get paid bi-weekly. I am Single, no kids and I put down 1 allowance when filling out my W4. I also have about 1k a year income from FAFSA grant for school.

I did go online to the IRS tax estimator and it claims id owe about 1.2k ...... I cant afford that even if I started paying right now.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Pro Rata Rule - Did I mess up?,"Hello, I had a question about whether I triggered the pro-rata rule and if so, how I can fix it. 

This year I did a backdoor roth IRA conversion for the full $7000. At the time immediately after I did the conversion, my traditional IRA account had a $0 balance. 

A couple months later, I rolled over my 401k account from a previous job into my IRAs. The balance from my roth 401k went into my roth IRA. The balance from my job's pre-tax 401k contributions went into my traditional IRA. Now that my traditional IRA has a balance, did I trigger the pro-rata rule?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Help with Pro Rata Mistake from 2022,"Hi there! I just realized that I may have broken the “pro rata rule” when I performed a Backdoor Roth conversion in 2022, because I had money in a traditional IRA (rollover PRE TAX money from old employer 401k). I want to fix it for 2024 because I utilized the Backdoor Roth again but realized my mistake this time.

I have a consult with a financial advisor on Monday but want to do what I can now to try and get traditional IRA moved out this year.

Timeline:
2021 - got a new job and rolled over 401k to traditional IRA

2022 - utilized backdoor Roth IRA conversion ($6000). I did not fill out 8606 correctly and was not aware of the pro rata rule. Had a balance of $96512 at year end in Traditional IRA.

2023 - regular Roth IRA contributions, no back door

2024 - utilized backdoor Roth IRA and read about the pro rata rule. Started the process of converting Traditional IRA balance to employer 401k but from what I’m reading, I would need to find how much to move to 401k vs Roth because they’re now “mixed”. I used Form 8606 and my basis should be $5649.

Question: can I convert $5649 to Roth IRA, and the remainder of my Trad IRA to employer 401k now? And then file amendment for 2022?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"Married filing jointly, no deductions, but owe tons of money every year?","Really hoping someone can explain because my husband and I are at a loss. My husband and I are married filing together. Our filing is super basic, we both just have 1 full time office job each. We don't have any deductions listed on our W4s so I assumed we would have been withheld appropriately automatically and pretty much broken even at tax time but instead we're being super under taxed and owing thousands of dollars which is a huge issue.

Are we supposed to be manually calculating our taxes and adding it as additional withholding? Is it because we're filing jointly? If we filed separately would that fix the issue?

Thank you in advance for the help! We are so confused

ETA: Solved! I think issue is that we did not have the multiple jobs section checked off on our W4s to account for us both working. Will also review the withholding calculator on the website to make sure filing together is better for us.

I sent them the screenshot from their website that shows rejected and she said no it’s accepted on my end and that there’s nothing to do. Has anyone had a similar problem?

\*\*\*edit: Yes I’ve checked IRS website, probably 30 times and it doesnt show anything for 2023.

I showed that to H&R Block and they said there’s nothing they can do because their screen shows accepted. My posting this was asking if anyone else had trouble with H&R Block, hoping it was a glitch.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Tax preparer mixed state residencies - filed 10/13/23,"Tax preparer mixed state residencies - filed 10/13/24

Hi, my tax preparer mixed up my residency states when he filed yesterday night 10/13.

He mixed my (actual nonresident) UT and (actual resident) MI state returns. We had been going back and forth via texts/calls and I had multiple W2s across both states which probably made things harder.

It is now showing I owe over $3,000+ penalties/interest to UT . Had it been done correctly, I would have owed $1400 to MI.

What is the chance of me being audited for this year or past years? 
-I can prove my residency here in MI 
-UT has a higher tax rate than MI so I don’t know  if states will think I’m evading taxes
-3/4 of my total federal income had UT taxes withheld because I hadn’t informed my employer I moved to MI until this year. My work is remote so I worked from home MI all year. I don’t know if that’ll make the states flag me more for review/audit.
-I didn’t itemized deductions for 2023 but for prior years, if I get audited, I’d  have to find donation receipts which are about $4,000-6000 a year.
-The IRS is fine. I don’t owe them anything.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,New USA Resident: Forgot to close an empty TFSA before moving to US,"Hi Everyone,

My situation is a bit complicated, so please excuse my long post.

I became a U.S. resident for tax purposes in October 2023 after winning the Green Card lottery (meeting the Green Card test) and just filed my first tax return to the IRS for the dual-status year 2023. However, I’ve run into an issue.

I had two TFSA accounts in Canada. I closed one before becoming a U.S. resident but forgot about the other. This second account was completely empty (it had literally $0, no positions, nothing) after August 2022 (my last withdrawal), and I left it open when I moved to the U.S. I only closed it in April 2024.

The unfortunate part is that I realized this mistake today—right after I submitted my 2023 tax return to the IRS yesterday.

**Schedule B (Form 1040)**

On Schedule B (Form 1040), there’s a question: “During 2023, did you receive a distribution from, or were you the grantor of, or transferor to, a foreign trust? If 'Yes,' you may have to file Form 3520.” I answered “No” and attached a statement saying: ""I had a TFSA account in Canada in 2023; however, it was closed before I became a U.S. resident for tax purposes. Therefore, I answered 'No' on the form.""

**Form 8938**

I also didn’t file Form 8938 with my 2023 return because I didn’t meet the threshold for filing:

>If you are a taxpayer living abroad you must file if:

>You are filing a return other than a joint return and the total value of your specified foreign assets is more than $200,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than $300,000 at any time during the year.

Although I became a U.S. resident in October 2023, I didn't move to the U.S. until January 2024, and the total value of my specified foreign assets in Oct - Dec 2023 was less than $200,000.

**FBAR**

I haven't filed my FBAR for 2023 yet, but I'm working on it.

**Questions**

1. Should I file an amended return for 2023? If so, what forms do I need to include?
2. Should I also send an amended version of Schedule B and change my answer to “Yes” for the foreign trust question?
3. Should I attach a new statement explaining that I had two TFSA accounts, and only one was closed before I became a resident?
4. I don't meet the threshold for Form 8938, but should I still file it since I had an empty TFSA account open while I was a resident?
5. Is there something else I can do to best address and fix this overall situation with the IRS?
6. How many days do you think I have to fix this with the IRS? **Note:** I don’t owe any money since I had no U.S. source income after becoming a U.S. resident for tax purposes; all my income was Canadian-sourced, and I claimed the FTC. My forms indicate I'm getting a refund because I overpaid in April when I requested an extension to file my taxes, and I’m supposed to receive the full amount I paid back.
7. Should the empty TFSA be reported on my 2023 FBAR since it remained open until April 2024?

Thank you!

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Need help with finding W2's for previous years unfiled returns and if my tax professional is right in their choice regarding my returns.,"I'm going to preface this by saying I have had a lot of trouble finding a couple W2 forms along with some personal issues that lead to an unreasonably long delay with getting my information to my tax professional after paying for their services.

I expressed concern to them from the start about getting these specific W2 forms form previous employers and they told me to try anyway which I did. For reference one company is long closed down and the other is a family run business I left on bad terms and they are throwing up roadblocks to get the actual W2 forms.

I reached out to my tax professional for advice on what to do next and if reaching out to the IRS should be my next step in order to get these W2 forms and they are now suggesting I file without the state information on my W2 and have prepared said returns for my review.

However I'm wondering if I have truly exhausted all my avenues for getting this W2 I have reached out to payroll companies and had no luck. I wanted to give some context but my question essentially is

Is filing without my state information (I'm in PA) really the best course of action in this situation? If not is there any way I can get the W2 forms or the state withholding information from a valid source my tax pro can use? I imagine without this filled in I will have to repay all the state taxes and I would rather not. Thanks for any and all help!",2024-05-06 17:15:34,1.0,25.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Retained earning discrepancies in tax,"I'll keep this short as I can.  I started a new position in private 2 months ago. I have 2 years in public (tax) and ran for the hill. Owner didn't have an accountant ot bookkeeper doing the books- she was an office administrator who wss helping- for 5 years. 
Owner files 2023 taxes and brings to me to review. I find three mistakes. One was where she took a 60k expense - twice! She had to amend immediately. 
Soooo I decided to go back to his inception (2018) and not only was the office administrator clearly changing things on years that taxes were filed, but the first year of his business, he has a (59k)  R/E that he is off balance by on the M2 R/E reconciliation worksheet. 
I checked 2019, 2020, 2021 hoping for book to tax ties and maybe thr R/E would shake out. Nope. 
Shes been consistently filing returns for 6 years with retained discrepancies. 
I brought all this up to her and she wants go fix it all, with my help of course. 
I told her no. It was up to her to fix mistakes she made. I was hired to do MY job, not hers and that I'm super busy with my day to day as it is. Now I feel bad- but honestly, this needs fixed. 
I can change the PL all day  everyday and agree it to net income- but that balance sheet? Wow. Missing liabilities. Assets missing that she captured to tax, assets on the bs that were actually  sold and on the return as sold, no one was ever tying book to tax (no depreciation or accumulated depreciation). I could go fix all that but AR AP AND inventory and cash balances were off as well consistently. Makes me wanna cry a bit. 

Anyone ever have a mess like this? 

Editing to say I asked her if she had journal entries that she was making each year on her end due to all the discrepancies. She said ""no. I just did the best I could with the information that I had"". Thr r/e is off balance by (283,000) as of 2023. 

Also editing to say I was not hired as a CPA. That was part of my hiring- specifically as well. No CPA services such as tax returns. Also, my 2 years in  public- in my first year I was  hired in March so I only did individual. 2nd year I did a handful of s corp. A handful enough to know I should be able to back into ordinary income from book to tax in a few seconds. (How I caught his mistake first and dove into it)  I work VERY part time (16 hrs) due to a back injury, and am paid at even below a bookkeeper rate. I'm ok with that. One back surgery  in and headed to another.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,H&R Block Failed to File State Taxes,"Not sure if this question is best suited for r/legaladvice or r/tax, so cross-posting to both.

**Contextual info:**

The tax year in question is 2020.

My wife and I married on March 24th, 2020. I've only ever lived and filed in Maryland. Prior to getting married, my wife lived in VA. She moved to Maryland in early March. This living arrangement was beyond my comfort level for self-filing, so we decided to make an appointment with H&R Block and have our taxes prepared and filed by a ""Tax Pro.""

**Timeline:**

On or around April 15th, 2021, we met in-person with a Tax Pro at an H&R Block office. At that meeting, the Tax Pro began initiated our returns by completing their internal forms. Additionally, we provided her with a void check for any deposits/withdrawals. While evaluating our tax scenario for VA and MD, she said she was unsure how to proceed and would need to do some research. She stated she would send us an electronic consent form to sign once the filing documents were complete.

On or around May 11, we received a notification in the H&R Block mobile app to approve the tax returns. The returns were approved electronically. As a note, this date was recently provided to us as the filing date for our Federal and VA taxes. I don't recall the specific date and the messages are no longer in our inbox within the H&R Block app.

**Recent events:**

Last week we received a letter from the Maryland Comptroller stating they did not have record of our 2020 filing. I logged into our H&R Block account and found a few documents, one of which clearly showed that a Maryland return was within the scope of work we agreed to and, further, that we owed the state. I could not find anywhere that indicated a date of filing for any of our returns.

On September 24th, 2024, I called H&R Block customer service who stated that the Tax Pro who handled our 2020 taxes was no longer under their employ. Instead, she scheduled a call with a manager at a local year-round office (for anonymity, I'll call her Susan).

On September 25th, 2024, Susan called me and after reviewing the taxes that were in the system, relayed the following:

* The 2020 Tax Pro completed and filed our Federal and Virginia taxes, but did not complete or file our Maryland taxes. They were still showing as ""in progress.""
* After reviewing our Virginia taxes, she believed they were actually done incorrectly. At the time of filing, we did not owe any money nor were we getting a refund. She said that we should have actually received about an $80 refund.
* The Maryland taxes were originally showing we owed $1,400, but she believed they should be lower. The now completed filings show us owing $653.
* Susan claimed that there is a statute of limitations of 3 years on refunds, so it would not make sense to file an amended return in Virginia.

Susan then said that I would need to visit a local branch for them to print our Maryland returns and we would need to pay the processing fee. She also stated we would be responsible for paper filing to the state. She said that she would try to get me a discount on the processing fee. I told Susan I wasn't as worried about the processing fee as I was penalties the state will likely assess. I told her that I'd prefer H&R Block to file on my behalf, along with a letter of explanation to the state of Maryland, and cover any associated penalties. Susan told me that we would need to file them ourselves, then submit the penalties as a reimbursement request once paid to the state, and that H&R Block would likely say that it was the customer's (our) fault for not following up when they weren't filed timely. I told her I understood the process as she explained. At this point, I didn't want to push back too hard in fear of getting my tax documents held up and further delay them being filed.

On September 28th, 2024, I met with a Tax Pro at another local H&R Block office to receive the printed forms (again, I'll call him Keith). Keith saw the now completed Maryland return but said he needed signatures from both myself and my wife. He was able to print the signature forms but said I needed to pay the processing fee before giving me the paper returns. As Susan mentioned, the fee was discounted. However, he experienced technical issues trying to get the point of sale system to bring up the sale for transaction. He advised me to go home, get my wife's signature, and then return. He called me on my way home and said the system was still not working correctly and asked if I could come back later in the week. We made an appointment for today at 2:30.

Today, my wife went back to the H&R Block office and they were able to bring up the sale for transaction and give her the paper forms. It appears the anticipated penalty amount to the state will be about $6,000.

We are planning to send the return by certified mail, along with a check for the amount that we owe, and a letter of explanation including the description of events above.

My questions:

* Should we communicate this directly to the state of Maryland or does H&R Block have any responsibility to do so on our behalf?
* Should we follow H&R Block's policy by paying any associated penalties and then filing a dispute claim or is there another avenue you recommend we take?
* Is there any need for us to seek legal representation in our communications with either H&R Block or the state?

Anecdotally, I just want all of this to be wrapped up. I have never written a bad review of a company or anything like this, but I am so incredibly frustrated. I am a very diligent person and it makes me feel like I've failed as a citizen by not filing and paying our taxes. I'm frustrated with H&R Block because we paid for a specific service with a specific scope of work and are basically being treated as if it's our fault they didn't complete it. We've now had several stressful calls and in-office visits with out much resolution aside from ""whoops, sorry about that. You'll need to file it yourself.""

I know I'm probably a bit biased due to my proximity to this issue, so I'm hoping you all can provide some insight or any info that can help point us in the right direction. Thanks!

TLDR; H&R Block failed to file our state taxes in 2020 and now we could potentially owe a $6,000 penalty and they don't seem too inclined to take any responsibility for it.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,IRS automation and AI,"Many have claimed that the IRS has been chronically underfunded for years resulting in poor customer service or that the tax code is so convoluted that it is impossible for the agency to administer the tax code efficiently resulting in outrageous processing times.

[IRS Return Workflow (from TaxPayer Advocate)](https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/get-help/roadmap/)

The solution proposed has been to throw money (bodies, equipment) at the problem under the rubric of ""modernization"". However, this is likely to result in ""throwing good money after bad"" continuing along a path that experience has shown worked poorly.

Instead, it is likely that the funds may be better spent reimplementing the IRS using AI.

Why AI?

1. The IRS has a huge amount of digitized data (tax code, taxpayer returns, tax court decisions, OIC settlements) to train AI models.
2. AI models work in parallel so all the steps in that convoluted IRS workflow are done at the same time rather than one step at a time.
3. AI models dont have workplace protections, i.e. unions.
4. AI models could be tuned to be more or less ""aggressive"" based on government revenue demands.
5. No more random audits. All returns go through the same process, i.e,. audit triggers are objectively applied to all returns.
6. Realtime decisions. No more multi-month delays for humans to review returns.

What could go wrong? (Plenty!)

1. Lois Lerner datasets. AI models will implement the biases of their training datasets.
2. AI incorrect decisions. AI models will extrapolate absent constraints (which we would consider hallucinations).
3. Substantial redundancies in IRS workforce.
4. AI makes decisions (but doesnt necessarily explain them). Can you explain why one face is beautiful while another is just plain. You just 'know' in an instant.
5. AI may make decisions differently than we do, i.e.Kasparov's comments on how computers play chess differently.
6. Very substantial resistance to change; demands to keep people 'in the loop' regardless of necessity.
7. Long lead times to fix AI models.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,My Dad passed away in 2018 and me and my sister inherited his house which was in Iowa. The house had a mortgage on it at the time. I lived in the house as my primary residence from 2018 to 2020. In 2020 the house became a rental.,"We sold the house in December 2023 for a profit of about $54,000 not including realtors’ fees and fixing up the house to sell it. The house remained in the name of the estate since the estate was open until 2023 when we decided to close the estate and sell the house. 

I recently filed my 2023 tax return, and I brought a statement of mortgage interest to my tax pro at H and R block. My tax pro told me that we were supposed to file yearly tax returns for the estate and a final tax return for the estate when the estate was closed in 2023. Unfortunately, my estate lawyer, real estate agent, local courthouse, escrow company and the real estate lawyer who handled the transaction didn’t tell me this. 

My sister and I both profited about $20,000 from the sale. What should we do now? I have not received any 1099 from the escrow company and haven’t received any notices from the state of Iowa.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Owing MI tax after expecting a nice return,"Hi,

         I am a college student who worked last summer and made just about 5k. I filed my taxes for the first time this year and was expected to get about $700 back from the state. I filed through TurboTax and got an email saying the state accepted it, then awhile later, the state said I was being manually reviewed and to look out for a letter at some point in the future. 
Today I got that letter saying that the home heating tax credit was rejected and my return  has been corrected to a tax due for $260. I’m really confused, how did I end up owing $260? I had the maximum amount of taxes taken out of each paycheck and got a federal return (granted it was only $17). I do NOT have the money to pay this as I am living less than paycheck to paycheck. The letter did say I could put in writing why I disagree with this, do you feel that would be a good option? 
Apologies if this reads poorly, I am freaking out about paying a crazy amount with money I absolutely do not have. Thank you in advance.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Recategorizing Roth IRA as 529 or Custodial Roth IRA,"I'm not the one who needs this help, just saw this in r/personalfinance and thought this would be a really fun (and painful) problem.

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fgzv26/discovered_my_rothira_is_actually_under_my_dads/

- OP at age 16 asked OP's dad to create Roth IRA for them, and had earned income to be able to contribute to it (""I worked really hard and tried to max it out every year."")
- Unfortunately OP's dad made a regular account, not a custodial one
- OP logs into dad's account to contribute to it (???)
- 4 years later OP realizes this is not a custodial account

So, assuming dad made an honest mistake and didn't just want to ruin their relationship with OP:

The easy way out would definitely be to leave it alone, and ask dad to pinky promise (or contractually with an estate lawyer's help) to name OP as the beneficiary, don't spend it, and die. Alternatively, as soon as dad turns 59.5, make him cash it out, and OP will just take that money and put it into a taxable brokerage instead.

The hard way... is there even a way to go back, fix this, with the brokerage's help and inform the IRS?

1. The first year I found the “best” as per Google reviews and very expensive who filed my taxes but asked me to pay $xxxx to release one of the calculations they did when IRS audited my taxes. I created a thread about the ethics of that using my old Reddit account on this subReddit and people unanimously agreed that he was on the wrong and I should report him. 
2. I found another one who didn’t know about 1341 and told me the money I overpaid last year is gone and I can’t get it back.

For each of these situations I was very heavily involved in scrutinising the files they created, and redid all the math myself, while learning about the rules. While that’s great, it takes a lot more of my time and I’m envious about the freedom I can have if I find someone I can trust for two three years. 

So TLDR : I’m fairly involved and have learnt a thing or two about taxes because of bad experiences with tax pros. What’s a good way to find them? Google or referrals haven’t worked.

Until this year, where, randomly, at the end of my taxes I was asked to review something I'd missed from my income.

It was information that, by all accounts, should have been imported from fidelity (I don't know much about stocks but I do light dabbling) along with the rest of my information, but just wasn't for some reason.

So here I am, ready to be done with taxes, and im basically being told ""Hey, we need you to get this ultra specific info from your 2021 taxes and figure out how it varies from your 2022 taxes in this ultra specific stock tax form, but we aren't going to tell you how to find it or what to look for. Have fun!""

Naturally, I searched around for an answer, even took to Google, and after an hour of completely unnecessary stress, I just entered 0 into the box.

It then asked me to do the same process for a different box, and I entered 0 again, and then I was finally done.

Due to how little I dabble in stocks, I don't think the amount mattered and definitely wasn't worth as much stress as it put me through, and frankly I have no clue why turbo tax couldn't just auto import it since I've done my taxes on there for the last few years (and I'm pretty sure they charged me to import my stock info smh).

For more info, this is all the info they gave me to find the number for the box. 

TY21 Sch D AMT ln 7

Anyway, my taxes are filed. My refund of around 3k didn't seem noticeably affected after I went back and entered the zeros into the two boxes. I am now only looking for reassurance of what will happen going forward. 

I googled and Google claims irs can fix small mistakes without the need to amend taxes (and i really dont want to amend over that bs). I figure if they look into it and see the two random 0's, it will be noticeable enough for them to quickly fix, hopefully. Though i honestly have no clue if what I entered lost or ""earned"" me a little bit of money, or made no difference at all. 

I guess my TL;DR question is this: If you don't know the answer to a stock tax form question and enter 0 on the TY21 Sch D AMT ln 7 box, as well as an additional box, will it either be a: no big deal, b: something that requires you to amend your taxes, or c) something that will make you owe money to the irs.

And if you do owe money to the irs, do they just mail you a form with details for you to pay online? I've never owed money but would be fine needing to pay a little as long as I don't need to do it through snail mail, its the worst.",2024-02-07 03:34:27,7.0,23.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

I contacted my preparer who basically told me that the tax return was done properly and to contact the IRS, they told me it was never received. After a few more calls to the preparer they finally looked at the return they filed and come to find out they entered a dependents social security number incorrectly and the system was rejecting the return.

Then Covid hit and I was not able to get in touch with the IRS for years. Two weeks ago I received a letter that the IRS is going to garnish my wages for the assessed taxes owed.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Accountant credited our refund to estimated tax liability for the coming year,"Hi all, we had someone new do our taxes this year, and the accountant filed our taxes (US) in a way that meant our overpayment would be contributed to the coming year’s tax bill. We likely will get a refund in 2024 without this additional pre-payment, assuming my pay structure remains the same. Normally I wouldn’t make a huge deal about this, but it’s a mid-5 figure number.     
     
Is there anything I can do to amend this filing and allow the IRS to deposit the refund into my account?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Re-filing to fix 3 years of ESPP deductions,"Hi, to my absolute horror I just realized I've been doing my taxes wrong since 10 years ago: I never adjusted my 1099-B for ESPP so have been double taxed. I think the double taxes are probably greater than what I've made from ESPP (haha what a first world problem). At first, I didn't panic and figured TurboTax would adjust it for me since it does ask you to input the ESPP numbers from your W-2 box 14. Nope, Form 8949 has no adjusted cost basis on the sales (why does TT even bother asking for that number if it's not going to do anything with it!?)

Anyway, before shelling out for a CPA, I want to figure out if I can do it myself. Here's my plan for review:

1. Start amending from my 2021 return. Even though, I've been making this mistake since 2015, it seems previous years are past the limit for when I can amend (I pay all of them around April 15th).
2. Use Form 3922 to calculate the discount that has already been taxed as income on my W-2. Add that discount to my the sale's cost basis from my 1099-B. I can do a sanity check by checking if the sum that is added to the cost basis equals the ESPP number from my W-2 box 14.
3. This will probably affect my capital loss, so when I start amending 2022, I need to start by adjusting the capital loss carryover on both the federal and state (CA).
4. Re-file 2022 return immediately. Based on [https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/after-you-file/discussion/amending-prior-years-capital-loss-carryforward/00/1850998](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/after-you-file/discussion/amending-prior-years-capital-loss-carryforward/00/1850998), it seems I can amend 2022's without waiting for the IRS to accept my 2021 return.
5. Repeat for 2023.

Is this plan sound? Any mistakes or improvements?",2024-05-22 05:35:50,1.0,7.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Saved by the incompetence or just screwed differently? From LLC to S-Corp and Back Again,"I started an LLC in 2022. As the sole owner, I immediately elected to be taxed as an S-corp via my registered agent, and conducted my business accordingly. This is where the problems begin. It turns out that he IRS never acted on (or received according to them) the S-corp designation form from my registered agent, and therefore in 2022 and 2023 I was considered an LLC for tax purposes. I immediately reached out to the IRS, let them know that they should have designated me as an S-corp and I have proof that the scorp election form was submitted on time in 2022. They said they would get back to me within 16 weeks. They further informed that my 2022 business return had never been processed because I was never officially designated an S-corp so they could not accept an s-corp return. They also never mailed me or informed me of this...they just waited until I called... In any event as this was getting messy, I decided to file an extension on my 2023 business tax and personal tax returns until I had more clarity on my 2022 situation.

Entirely separately, while waiting to hear from the IRS, I went back and reviewed my 2022 business return and personal return. What I found was somewhat horrifying. My now ex-accountant had filed my 2022 business tax return as an S-corp, but then when he filed my personal return, he failed to attach my schedule k-1 🤯🤯😳😳. So effectively, the 40k in profits my company made, which should have been recorded as distributions for tax year 2022 on my personal return (even though I actually transferred the profits to my personal account in 2023) never had any taxes paid on them. After a bit of panic I came to the conclusion that an amended 2022 personal tax return was required and that I would just have to urgently pay the taxes owed , as well as penalties. But regardless, I still needed to hear from the IRS confirming they had fixed my S-corp designation.

Fast forward to today, and sure enough today I got a letter from the IRS saying they have confirmed my s-corp election, but because I did not submit in a timely manner, the designation is only effective as of 2024. 🤔🤔🤔

My immediate reaction was "" holy f-ing sh\*t. this saga just does not want to end!"" When I had called the IRS agent on the phone previously, they had told me they did not need the proof that I had submitted my s-corp designation form in 2022, because this happens all of the time. Well, that simply did not turn out to be true.

**So, riddle me this Reddit:** Was I actually saved by the fact that for 2022 my business was an LLC and not a Scorp? Or is it more beneficial to fight the man.

**Option 1: Saved by incompetence:** In this option, I Just run with it, consider myself lucky and retroactively consider my business an LLC for 2022 and 2023. The logic being that LLCs allow for retained earnings, and so rather than filing an amended 2022 return, I could just submit a 2023 return that shows my business distributed the retained earnings from 2022 to the sole owner in 2023.  There would be no amended return and no penalties for failure to pay what would have amounted to unreported k-1 income had I my scorp election gone through in 2022. The cost of this approach would be that I have to pay the 15.3% FICA for employee and employer on the 40k of profits. So about $6ish k

**Option 2: Fight the man:** In this option, I push back and provide the IRS proof that I elected to be taxed as an Scorp in 2022, and have my tax status updated retroactively accordingly. My 2022 scorp business return gets released from IRS purgatory and promptly let me know I owe back taxes and have penalties to pay. I would have to file my amended 2022 personal return to report the k-1 income, pay the taxes owed on the distribution, and pay whatever penalties come my way. The only benefit of this approach that I see would not be paying FICA on the taxes. The cost would be paying penalties, having to fight more, and looking bad in the eyes of the IRS and potentially opening myself to further scrutiny (which would be fine--nothing to hide, but aint nobody got time for an audit).

**Is there an option 3? Is my logic correct in option 1 and option 2? Am I neglecting anything major? What would you do and why?**

From the letter it looks like I have the option to not respond and to have them take what they have already to review. I would prefer to go that route to avoid them asking questions on every transaction, though I don't want not responding to cause additional issues. To be clear, everything is legit and I'm not trying to avoid or hide anything, I just don't want to deal with this more than I have to.

How bad of an idea is it to not respond to this and let them compute what's needed via what they've already received from filing? I assume they just get a summary of what the IRS gets.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Removal of Excess Roth Contribution - Vanguard,"In Jan 2022, my wife and I both contributed the max $6k to our Roth IRA accounts. At the end of the year, it turns out we are above the MAGI limit to be eligible for Roth contributions. I am able to recharacterize and backdoor for myself. Easy.

My wife had a large Rollover IRA,however, and rather than fight with pro-rata stuff, we just decide to do a removal of excess contributions for the full $6000 (with the understanding that any earnings would be taxed). I used Vanguard's Removal of Excess Contributions portal to do so. Thought everything went off without a hitch.

Fast forward to today, I receive a letter from the IRS showing a $4,783 distribution that is taxable. I go check the 1099-R for that account from that year which shows the following:

Box 1 (Gross Distribution): $4,783

Box 2a (Taxable Amount): $0

Box 7 (Distribution Code): 8,J

Box 16 (State Distribution): $4,783

Go back to my bank records for that period, sure enough that $4,783 ended up in my checking account. The remaining $1,217 stayed in the Roth IRA settlement account. The IRS is now attempting to tax the $4,783.

So I've got a few questions:

1) Why was the $6k split up like that and only part of it distributed?

2) Why does the IRS see this $4,783 as taxable? Even if this was not a removal of excess contributions, should this not be viewed as removal of principal and thus not taxable?

3) What should be my next steps here? I am assuming contacting Vanguard, but with their run around, I would like to go in with a clear strategy and instruction on what they need to do to make any fixes.",2024-05-10 00:02:08,1.0,2.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Untangling Nondeductible Contributions to Traditional IRA,"Looking back through the past few years of my tax returns, I realized I've been making nondeductible contributions to my traditional IRA for those years (nondeductible due to AGI limit). My traditional IRA also has older deductible contributions and, obviously, earnings from both contributions in it.

I'm thinking that the best way to fix this is to somehow reverse rollover the deductible portion of my IRA into my 401k (pending confirmation from my 401k custodian that they accept it), and then perform a Roth conversion on the nondeductible money in the IRA. I believe that would let me avoid the pro rata rule.

However the issue I run into is that I'm not sure it's possible to separate the nondeductible earnings from the deductible earnings, especially since some of those contributions were made a few years ago, and there's a sizeable number of transactions made within the IRA since then as it's an actively managed account.

I suspect the best approach will be for me to:

1. Move the deductible IRA contributions into a separate account
2. Reverse rollover the deductible IRA contributions into my 401k
3. Perform a Roth conversion on what remains in the account, which will essentially be (nondeductible contributions + earnings from nondeductible contributions + earnings from deductible contributions).

I assume that with this strategy I'm still getting bit by the pro rata rule and paying more taxes than if I had done this all correctly years ago, but is there a better solution that I'm not seeing?",2024-02-15 18:34:50,1.0,9.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Need a second opinion on CPA handling HSA Withdrawal of Excess Contributions,"Hi there. So I got my taxes done by a CPA earlier today, and I need a second opinion on how he handled my HSA overcontribution for 2023.

So here's what happened:

* I contributed $3850 to my HSA through my employer in 2023 (what I thought was my maximum amount to contribute).
* Found out in 2024 for that my maximum contribution should have been pro-rated by the number of months that I was enrolled in an HDHP - which is 4 months. So my adjusted max is 4/12 \* 3850 = $1283.33.
* In Feb of 2024, I contacted the HSA and withdrew the difference, which was $2,597.35 ($2566.67 + interest) from the 2023 contributions to get it down to my adjusted maximum contribution amount.

When the CPA did my taxes today, he filled out Form 8889 using the full $3850 on lines 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11 in part 1. Everything else is blank. Left Part II and III blank.

When I asked if he should've accounted for the withdrawal (and showed him the check sent from my HSA provider), he said that he cannot account for the withdrawal yet, since I have not received Form 1099-SA that would show that I've gotten distributions from the HSA. Since I haven't received the form, he can only report the HSA amount based on line 12b of my W2. He said he could only file based on the tax forms received, and to wait for the next tax year filing to report the withdrawal amount + earnings.

Did the CPA do this correctly? By doing this, will I get penalized for overcontributing to the HSA for tax year 2023? How does the IRS know that I've already withdrew my excess contributions for 2023 (or does it not matter until I file for tax year 2024)?

And if the CPA did this wrong... how do I go about fixing it lol

\--

I thought that in order to correct the HSA overcontribution, I would fill out Form 8889 as follows:

* Part I - $1283.33 on lines 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11
* Part II - $2,597.35 on lines 14a and 14b

And then report $2,597.35 on Form 1040 Part 1 Line 8f.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,U.S. Childcare Tax Credit Year 2023,"Hey pros, I think HR Block software may be letting me down this year with regards to calculating the child care tax credit. Before I get into that though - let me preface quickly. I know using the HR Block self service software is kind of a rip-off. I use it for convenience and pre-filling of most fields. It's worked pretty well up until this year.

To describe my situation: HR Block seems to be calculating my credit incorrectly. I paid for pre-k for my daughter in the spring semester of 2023 - $3,440 to be exact. Based on my understanding of the credit, a maximum of $3,000 is usable for one child and $6,000 for two or more for filing year 2023. The credit is based on a bracket-tiered system based on income. My credit coefficient should be .2 (20%) - my adjusted gross income is in the top bracket of $43,000 or greater. Notwithstanding subtracting employer dependent care benefits (which I don't have), this seems pretty easy: $3000 * 0.2 = $600.

However, HR Block told me the calculation was hard and I'd need to pay $65 for tax pro review. When I politely declined and elected to calculate it myself, they required me to agree to their expectation that the IRS might find my return suspect. Then they gave me an incorrect number based on the data I had entered - $659. Given my AGI and coefficient from form 2441, I figured this must be wrong. I also incorrectly assumed that HR Block would handle the max of $3000 in credit calculations. After adjusting the dependent care expense field to $3000, HR Block is saying I'll get $571. Again, without any employer care benefit, I'm not sure what else should be affecting what seems to be a really straightforward calculation. Where is the other $29? I doubt I can even look at the forms they're compiling to check without paying them first.

Anyone else running into this issue? Am I off base here? Kind of feels like HR Block tried to shake me down for money and gave me the bird when I declined - but maybe I'm missing something.",2024-02-03 22:08:55,1.0,7.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Roth 401(k) Accidentally Rolled into Traditional Rollover IRA,"     Apologies for the length, just really stuck and wanted to include the relevant info. Back in February of 2023, I rolled over $20,000 from a previous company's Roth 401(k) into a Traditional Rollover IRA with Fidelity. This should not have been possible - transferring between different types of tax advantaged accounts like this is illegal. However, at the time, I was not aware that the rollover IRA was traditional (silly, I know), there were no controls to prevent it, and I only just realized when I started doing my taxes this year. In the time the money has been in the account, it has accrued an additional ~$1000 of earnings.

     After contacting Fidelity several times, each person gave me different instructions. They were, in order:
     1.   Complete an IRA recharacterization form. However, that does not apply to a rollover contribution like this, so it wouldn't process. So I called Fidelity again.
     2.   Perform a roth conversion, but that is not possible because the initial rollover was illegal since it went from Roth to traditional. So they transferred me to a new rep
     3.   The new rep told me to contact a tax accountant and do as they instruct. After calling a tax accountant I was informed that this should be able to be fixed by Fidelity since my 2023 taxes have not yet been submitted. So I called Fidelity again
     4.   This time, Fidelity said that due to the rollover happening ~1 year ago, the only thing that could be done is to complete a Return of Excess, have the funds sent back to me, then complete a Certification for Late Rollover Contribution. This would create a taxable event that would need to be reported on my 2024 taxes

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Is Turbo Tax more convenient than IRS website?,"I'm one of those people that waits till the last second to do my taxes, usually it's week of or the day before/tax day.  I've been working since I was a teenager, freelancing since 2005, used to have someone prepare my taxes for me every year and it would cost me an arm and a leg until I just started doing em 8 years ago.  Don't get me wrong, I used to pay turbo tax a lot too when I first started out cause I used to get more than their basic plan but I started to just make the extra effort little by little to do everything myself.  Like I said I would usually wait, reason is because I can work for somewhere between 20 to 30 or 40 to 50 different companies or clients within a tax year.  Waiting for w2's, 1099's, w4's etc... then having to make the time to input them into the site and double checking, fixing errors or whatever else, it just would take forever.  This year I had 4 clients one of which employed me for about 8 months so it only took me 2 hours to file but I wonder if I should have done em on the IRS site because they were so easy to do.  I paid under $200 with Turbo tax and that's without their current promotion.  If you file before the end of the month you get $100 dollars back but that's only if you go with their expensive tax expert plan which in my opinion isn't worth it.  I just go at it alone now, they offer so much other protection plans at checkout that I decline em all as well.  I've been fine with more complicated years I'll be fine now.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"51 Weeks W2, 1 Week K1 and Deductions"," Hi Tax Friends,  


Long time reader, rare poster. Thanks in advance. Late in 2023 I transitioned from an associate (W2) to a partner (K1) at my company and my final paycheck was K1 income. This amount was modest (\~7k), and only represented one week of work. I consulted with an accountant who stated I should be able to ""zero this out"" through deductions. Since I was only a K1 employee for a week out of the entire year, I'm not sure if this is true. Here's a few deductions my accountant recommended after reviewing my case:  


\- Society dues and courses (paid in late April and early December for \[late\] 2023 and 2024) dues, or two years worth. Can I deduct both?  
\- Umbrella (personal) insurance (paid earlier in the year)  
\- Work equipment (Loupes) - paid in August  
\- Repairs on my personal vehicle, which I use 90% for work purposes (pro-rated), incurred in late August.  
\- Home office use (I use my personal office at home for work related purposes, a little over half of its use is for work)  


Aside from a few small holiday gifts (team building activity) and gas, none of these expenses were paid during the last week when I was on the K1, but certainly the benefits of many (Equipment, Society Dues) were used during that last week. Do you think I can deduct these items? Thanks in advance!",2024-04-09 05:47:23,2.0,1.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Correct Steps For Prior Year Traditional IRA Deposit And Backdoor Roth Conversion?,"Hello! I am learning about the backdoor Roth and wanted to ask if I have everything correct. 

* I did not make any contributions to my Traditional IRA in calendar year 2023. 
* My only IRA accounts are my Roth and my Traditional IRA so I do not believe the pro-rata rule will impact me.
* My traditional IRA has a $0 balance
* I am under 50. 
* My income is over the income limits for direct Roth contribution.  


Are these the correct steps and are there any issues that could arise with timing? Thank you in advance!  


1. Today (in 2024), contribute $6,500 (non-deductible) to my Traditional IRA for 2023 (even tho it's 2024 I want to count that contribution for 2023 and I think I can since it's before 2023 tax deadline)
2. A few days later, contribute $7,000 (non-deductible) (my 2024 contribution)
3. Another few days later, convert the total $13,500 to my Roth IRA (backdoor Roth)
4. Submit an 8606 for the $6,500 contribution AND the 5498 that my brokerage gives me with my 2023 tax return 
5. In 2025, submit an 8606 form for the $7,000 I contributed with my 2024 tax return. 

  
As I'm writing this I wonder, would it be better to contribute the $7,000 after the 2023 tax deadline and then convert the $13,500 after the 2023 tax deadline as well to avoid any issues with the amount showing on the 2023 5498? ",2024-01-07 22:49:08,1.0,8.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Roth IRA overcontribution,"Hello folks,

Doing our taxes on FreeTaxUSA, and got to the end where they provide a review of your return. It states that my wife and I overcontributed to our Roth IRA during the year because our MAGI is in-between the max contribution amount for 2023 (married filing jointly, $218k-228k). We were at \~$227k, so right on the line, and the tax software said that we were only allowed to contribute $300 each.

My question is: how do I go about withdrawing the excess contributions and backdooring them back into the Roth? At the moment, they are already invested in funds; do I sell the amount needed to prevent the penalty, transfer to my bank account, transfer back to a regular IRA, then recharacterize from there (for the 2023 tax year)? This would be my first time doing a backdoor... so not as familiar with the process.

Or would it be easier to call our brokerage (Fidelity) to sort this out?

If I've already submitted our taxes, and we fix the overcontribution, do I need to file an amended return to specify that we withdrew the excess contribution?

In 2019, my wife opened a traditional IRA account using $3,111.16 in rollover funds from an old 401K. In 2020, she recharacterized $1,818.51 ($2,350 minus 2019 investment losses) for the 2019 tax year from her Roth IRA into this same traditional IRA. 

In 2023, my wife recharacterized $5,382.12 ($6,000 minus 2022 losses) for the 2022 tax year into a new traditional IRA account. This money was then transferred back to her Roth IRA. 

In 2023, I also recharacterized $5,503.06 ($6,000 minus 2022 losses) for the 2022 tax year into a new traditional IRA account. This money was then transferred back to my Roth IRA. Both recharacterizations were a result of excess contribution because our income was over the Roth IRA income limit. 

The current balance of my wife's traditional IRA with pre-tax and post-tax money is $8,901.61.

My goal is to continue contributing to our Roth IRAs in the future using the backdoor strategy.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Plan review request: Backdoor Roth IRA Contribution with a surprise TradIRA and incomplete conversion in 2023.,"Looking to confirm my understanding and get feedback on my plan for a situation involving a surprise Traditional IRA and a partially incomplete backdoor Roth contribution.  

The situation:  I've been doing backdoor Roths for some years now using Fidelity.  **First complication**:  In 2023, I contributed the max to my Traditional IRA but then forgot to actually transfer it over to my Roth.  I only noticed this in early 2024 when I contributed the 2024 max to my Traditional. S**econd complication**:  A previous employer closed out a 401k I didn't know I had and rolled the $2500 balance over to a Traditional IRA in my name in 2023 (Inspira bank).  I understand this introduces the Pro-Rata conversion rules which could complicate a backdoor Roth.  

Looking for feedback on my plan:

1)  Today:  I'll transfer the entirety of my current Fidelity TradIRA ($6500 from 2023, a few $10s in interest, and $7000 from 2024) to my Fidelity Roth IRA.  

2)  I'll transfer the surprise $2500 Inspira TradIRA over to my now-empty Fidelity TradIRA and then transfer that into my Fidelity Roth IRA just like any other backdoor conversion.  

3)  For 2023 tax filing, I'll file the 8606 declaring the $6500 2023 TradIRA contribution as non-deductible.  

4)  For 2024 tax filing, I'll likely have some math to work through, but will expect to pay taxes on (a) the few $10s of interest I accrued in 2023 in my Fidelity TradIRA, and (b) the $2500 that I'm converting from pre-tax TradIRA (401k rollover) to post-tax Roth IRA.  Because I'm fully closing out all my TradIRAs, hopefully that makes the Pro-Rata calculations pretty straightforward.  

5) For 2025, tax filing, I'm back to normal backdoor Roth filings with no pro-rata issues to worrry about, right?

As I done in the past, I did a backdoor Roth IRA conversion (6.5k after tax dollars put into a separate traditional IRA, then transferred balance to my existing Roth IRA).

Any advice to fix my mistake or mitigate damage? Otherwise, my understanding is that my 6.5k conversion will be subject to high taxes (ouch!!) and I will need to do paperwork every year for the $55k traditional ira since it has a blended mix of tax/pre-tax money due to that pesky pro-rata rule.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Form 8889 HSA Income,"I am reviewing my taxes from 2022 in preparation for fixing an HSA overcontribution from last year. My employer over contributed to my HSA and I did not withdraw the excess before the October tax deadline.

I used TurboTax to prepare my tax filing and I notice that it entered the over contribution amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040) Additional Income Line 8f. However, I am reading the instructions for the form and it says Line 8f should be entered as the sum of Form 8889 Lines 16 and 20, both of which are 0 for me as I did not withdraw the excess (or make any distributions at all for that matter) from my HSA, and I have no additional tax for failure to maintain HDHP coverage. So I would expect that line to have been 0.

Is this a mistake (bug) from TurboTax?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Update to my pro-rata mistake. Rollover IRA realization has delayed me a bit and I still haven't filed my 2023 taxes (I'm due a refund and I did file an ext but obv that was for 10/15..,"Original title was describing how I'm doing a backdoor Roth IRA (but made the mistake of doing the conversion in October 2023 while only just remembering in Oct 2024 that I have a relatively small $4700 Rollover IRA sitting at Fidelity...so I wanted to know how to proceed with next steps but added now that I haven't submitted my 2023 return yet and because that's not submitted/finalized wanted to see exactly how I should enter things to account for and manage my pro-rata mistake. Where and exactly how do I (and should I) account for my $4700 Rollover IRA in Fidelity?

According to what I've learned on White Coat Investor (quite a good backdoor Roth walkthrough), I should have turned that rollover IRA into a Roth IRA before Dec 31st of 2023. Some data points, these aren't meant to be in any particular order, but I have numbered them to make referencing them easier for the kind folks on here as they help

1. I haven't filed my 2023 taxes, I'm in the middle of it in TurboTax but I stopped to read more about pro-rata once I realized the fidelity rollover IRA would count as part of my total IRA. I'm going to be getting a federal and state refund as I usually do.
2. I **contributed** $6000 to a Vanguard traditional IRA money market fund in April 2023 (for 2022 tax year) and then October of 2023 is when I did my **conversion** to the Roth IRA for that 6k, but looks like I was supposed to have checked to see if I had any rollover IRAs (and SEPs, etc) so that I could get rid of them by Dec 31st of 2023, but I didn't do this as I had forgotten I only had 1 and it was at fidelity while the rest of my funds are with Vanguard.
3. My spouse (who is the sole earner) does not have any rollover IRA, SEP, etc IRAs (only IRA they have is the 6000,6500,and7000 contributions to 1 traditional IRA money market fund in Vanguard which will eventually be used for conversion to backdoor Roth)
4. I don't work anymore, and my spouse who is the breadwinner doesn't have any traditional IRAs like a rollover, SEP, etc. I do the taxes using turbotax and I haven't ever done my spouse's **conversion** yet. I have only done 1 conversion, and it was only for the $6k 2022 contribution amount. I still have the 2023 and 2024 ($6500 and $7000) contributions sitting in the traditional IRA money market since when I made them in April 2024. Going forward I will try to be more timely in the contribution to conversion step, but for now my main concern is to enter things correctly in TurboTax so that I can handle my pro-rata mistake.

WCI's site says this about my situation:

""What If You Didn't Empty the IRA?

What if you screwed this one up? Your Backdoor Roth IRA conversion step just got pro-rata'd. There is a tax bill associated with that because most of your conversion was of tax-deferred money rather than post-tax money like it was supposed to be.

The fix for this is going to vary by the individual, but the easiest fix is to simply convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now, so you end up getting all your post-tax money into that Roth IRA. Another possible fix is to figure out a way to separate your basis in that IRA, roll the tax-deferred money into a 401(k), and then convert the basis left behind in the IRA.

Do yourself a favor and just empty the darn IRA by December 31. Keep in mind that this is usually not an instantaneous process, so don't put it off until you're on holiday break at the end of the year.""

I don't understand how to do what he (the author, Jim Dahle) is suggesting. ""The fix for this is going to vary by the individual, but the easiest fix is to simply convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now, so you end up getting all your post-tax money into that Roth IRA. Another possible fix is to figure out a way to separate your basis in that IRA, roll the tax-deferred money into a 401(k), and then convert the basis left behind in the IRA.""

I guess the easiest fix is to convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now according to the above. So, does that just mean that I call up Fidelity and convert the $4700 Rollover IRA to a Fidelity Roth IRA? And then what do I do? How do I correct things now that I made that pro-rata mistake? If I do nothing then I think I’m taxed extra for my pro-rata error, how can I minimize the damages for my mistake?

**As I'm in the middle of doing my 2023 taxes now, I have learned thanks to the fine folks on reddit that my 8606 for the 2022 tax year might be incorrect on line 6 ""Enter the value of all your traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs as of December 31, 2022, plus any outstanding rollovers.""**

So, 2 questions from this:

1. Should my $4700 Rollover IRA that sits in Fidelity have been written on line 6?
2. For my 2023 taxes do I include $4700 for my Fidelity Rollover IRA + the $6500 + $7500 that's in the Vanguard traditional IRA (the ones that are part of the contribution part of the backdoor, i.e. step 1, with step 2 being the conversion to Roth which I should do sooner rather than later, now that I'm understanding all of this much better). I thought that the 6500 and 7500 contributions don't get calculated towards the pro-rata rule, but clearly I'm still learning lol.
3. What is the step by step of what I should do regarding:

3A) 2022 Form 8606. What should I do about this? What would happen if I just left the 2022 Form 8606 as is and changed my Fidelity Rollover IRA to a Roth IRA next week or so?

3B) 2023 tax filing and how to report properly. Seems like I have 2 years of pro-rata because of having that Fidelity Rollover IRA existing in both 2022 and 2023, as in, only now in 2024 am I going to be calling Fidelity and having them change that Rollover IRA to a Roth IRA, and speaking of, is that the best thing to be doing with the Fidelity Rollover IRA considering it's a fairly small amount in this sort of context.

3C) Roth Conversion: How do I go ahead and report the conversion that I did last year of the 6k and how do I report the Roth conversions that I'll do in a few weeks for the $6500 and $7000 amounts (or I can do right now if you think that's best)

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"Review of Multiple Tax Advantaged Account Strategy (401Ks, IRA)","All,

I (28) am in the process of cleaning up and refining my financial strategy, starting with my tax advantaged accounts.

**Current breakdown:**

* Traditional 401K with previous employer: $21K
* Roth 401K with current employer: $96K. I'm currently maxing this out at $23K/yr; employer contributes additional $5K/yr.
* Roth IRA - $20K balance (can not contribute further the ""front door"" way due to income)

**Proposed plan:**

* Start backdoor Roth IRA contributions by setting up traditional IRA account
* Roll Traditional 401K into current employer (allows for both trad or roth 401Ks). Planning on doing this instead of rolling into traditional IRA to avoid pro-rata tax conversion on backdoor contributions.
* Shift current 401K into traditional 401K (advice needed here, current marginal tax bracket is at the top range of 24%, with my husband and I bringing in around $370K annually)

Does this seem appropriate? Any other advice on how to best approach? For context, outside of this I have $140K in a taxable brokerage account and $110K in a HYSA. Tackling those next.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Vanguard roth ira excess contribution and taxes .  How to fix? ,"Hello... I filled my taxes yesterday and already got approved.   However I feel that I have more questions and made incorrect actions on my (and my husband's)  roth ira accts.  Here's a recap: 

- Filed taxes yesterday.  Already filed and state/ federal accepted.
- during filing, Turbo Tax alerted me that spouse and I went over roth ira contribution limit since we were ~2k over the MAGI.
- Transferred the excess contribution of $4.7k each back into our money market account that same day. 
- I didn't remove the earnings from the excess. 
- Reported on my Turbo Tax that I withdrew the excess amount and kept the correct contribution in. 

TODAY... I called Vanguard and the rep said:

- I took the wrong steps and should not have withdrawn back into my moneymarket.  
- that early withdrawal will be subject to penalties
- IRS will get flagged that my earnings stayed in the Roth IRA acct.

Thoughts? How to fix this?

It seems as though I need to clear this up some more with Vanguard and resolve my tax situation.   I do all my tax work via turbo tax.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Seemingly always digging a deeper hole with no way out - advice? ,"Hi there! 

I'm a newb to this community, so please forgive me if I am asking redundant questions. However, I think everyone's situation is a bit different. 

Here's my family's scenario:

- family of 4 (me, my husband, and his 2 kiddos - a 16 year old girl and 18 year old boy that is on the autism spectrum).

- I have numerous chronic health conditions that prevent me from working outside the home because each day and level of pain is different. I have filed for SSI disability in April 2023 and now I'm the queue to be processed, but my state has an average wait time of 18-24 months, routine denials and appeals, and an 86-90% denial rate. Nearly every case has to be brought before a judge for a decision - and that can take up to 3-5 years, depending on workload.

To keep my mind occupied, I went back to school to earn my bachelor's of fine arts in graphic design online. Vocational Rehabilitation covers the costs of books, tuition, supplies, materials, tuition, internet, and fuel mileage to/from all medical appointments, as well as my health insurance premium each month. While there is a LOT of paperwork and red tape to deal with using VR, I cannot complain because they have provided me EVERYTHING I need to be successful - even new MacBook pros, iPad Pro, cloud storage, software.... The list goes on. 

- My husband works as a automotive technician in a new car dealership about 35 minutes each way from home. He has been in the industry for over 25 years. His current employer and direct manager seem to be decent to work with and he likes this job so much better than the last.

HOWEVER, when he started at this current job one year ago this past February, he hired on at $25/hour with the lromoiof a review in 90 days and the possibility of raise if he produced quality, profitable work with little to no customer comebacks (customer complaints). My husband has excelled at this job because he is the most experienced in this shop of 25-30 lifts, besides the senior mainline master  mechanic. He received his raise of $1/he by June 1, 2023, placing him at $26/hr. 

But, about two months ago, his manager approached him about possibly becoming the shop foreman - watching over the other mechanics, assisting them with tasks they are not fluent or efficient with, and generally coaching the team towards better and fast completion rates, upsells, and general increase in their skill set/knowledge. 

One would think that this was an opportunity to move up - it is a supervisory position that comes with added responsibility, extra accountability, becoming lead trainer for new employees, and less time of my husband working on his own lift - and that it would come with a raise. Bot no. I'm baffled at the arrangement because he went from $26/hr to $15/he and then he makes 50¢ off of every hour the other mechanics he supervises, bills out. For example, just for my husband being at the shop from 8-5, he will make $120/day base pay. If the 4 techs under him can bill 8 hr/day each, that is a total of 32 hours x 50¢ - or $16/day in commission. That's roughly at $680/week gross paycheck. By the time taxes, insurance, retirement, etc are deducted, he might come home with a $500/week paycheck. 

Before this change in position, as a regular automotive tech, he could easily flag 38-45 hrs/week at $26hr = $1092 gross/week (based on 42 hours/week) - an average of nearly $700-725/week net.

That is a loss of about $800 per month (about $200 per week).

I should also mention that if he and his team can meet monthly quotas for upsells and accuracy percentages, he is eligible for a $500/month bonus (averages out to $125/week). Even with the monthly bonus he is still making less now than he was, though he will not listen to me. He's such a pushover when it comes to working and helping others - easily taken advantage of, maybe because when he's the martyr, he's getting that attention, praise, and ""atta boy"" that he secretly ut desperately craves. 

Otherwise, logically and mathematically, I can't make sense of the numbers. 

My husband the sole income earned for our household. Since my stepson turned 18 and is considered a legal adult (although realistically, he's 12 years old mentally and emotionally), the SSA cut his monthly disability benefits. We are currently awaiting a new case manager to assist in helping him regain those benefits and add any other possible benefits for him. 

Needless to say, our expenses each month surpass the monthly income, leaving us to bridge the gap with credit cards, and at times (against my will or consent) payday loans. I hate payday loans because the APR is 299.00% compounding. Each week, the payday loan company automatically takes half of my husband's paycheck to make that payment. 

We live in a 714 sq ft, 3 br/1 ba early 1900s bungalow with a basement. Since we rent the house, we are responsible for all utilities, trash, and yard maintenance. 

Here's our monthly breakdown;

Water/electric: ~$200.00

Natural Gas: ~60.00

Rent: $350.00 (our portion as my parents help us with the remaining $400 each month)

Groceries: ~$150.00/week

Fuel for my husband (commutes about 400 miles/week): $400.00

Fuel for my vehicle (mostly reimbursed by VR): $250.00

Streaming services (we do not have cable or satellite TV) ~$75.00

Monthly vehicle maintenance: ~$25/mo unless an emergency repair pops up

Vehicle insurance: ~$170.00

Household insurance (renter's insurance) ~$30.00

CCLI insurance for my husband and me: ~$30.00

Vehicle extended warranty/service plan (husband's vehicle): $150.00

2 vehicle loan payments: $1,276.00

Internet service (reimbursed by VR): $89.99

Health insurance premium (me only): ~$70.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Credit card payments: ~$1,050.00 (~$40,000 credit card debt + accruing interest averaging 25%)

Payday Loan: ~350.00 (+200.00% APR - original loan amount was $1,350.00 - current balance with interest as of today - $1,754.13, even after $675.00 in payments so far)

Monthly subscriptions used for school (cloud storage, reference sites, stock art, etc.):  ~$80.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Medical bill payments: ~30.00

Trash service: $60.50 every 3 months (~$20.17/mo)

Cell phone service: ~$200.00 for 2 lines and phones 

Husband insists on eating out every day at lunch during the week: $400.00

Entertainment/Dining Out together: ~$250.00

Pet care/supplies/food: $175 every 6 weeks

--------
Total monthly outflow: ~$6,000-7,000

Husband's income: ~$2,400.00
Monthly Bonus (if earned): $500.00
Monthly VR reimbursement: ~$740.00
Pet sitting side hustle (not reliable or steady) - Average of ~$60/mo +/-

TOTAL INCOME: ~$3,860.00

Overbudget: ~ $2140.00-3140.00

This is a crisis. 

I know the credit card debit, vehicle payments, payday loan and the cut in my husband's salary, and my physical inability to work because of my health are the pain points. However I am overwhelmed and at a loss as to how to even make and balance a budget with this much disparagement. 

I've thought about making an appointment with either financial planner or debt counselor to see if they can help me work out a plan. My state offers a free service for debt counseling. I met with them once and their only solution was bankruptcy, which I couldn't even afford to pay for. 

We are in our mid-to-lats 40s and really do not want to do bankruptcy as we have a dream to build a home on part of my parent's acreage in the country. Currently, our credit scores are around the 615-625 mark and we are utilizing 51-56% of our credit (keeping the credit score low due to the debt ratio).

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone have any legitimate suggestions or resources to make a plan and then this situation around? I am sick of the daily stress. DCF claims that we make too much each month - the calculate off of the gross income, although no one lives off their gross income - so we are not eligible for SNAP or LIHEAP (utility assistance program) assistance.

My husband refuses to discuss our finances - I think mostly because he knows we're in so deep and it feels like the weight of it is all on his shoulders, that he's not doing s good enough job, etc. He does like to bury and avoid issues. So frustrating. 

Any logistical help would be appreciated - resources, software for planning, etc 

Thank you. :)",2024-07-25 14:17:34,147.0,131.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Used car purchase. Is it too much car?,"**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the thoughtful and productive discussion. If the crowd saying ""No"" to any and all car purchases would kindly come fix my junker for me, that would be great... 

**Original Post:**

Well my (27M) old, hand-me-down clunker got a ""do not resuscitate"" review from the mechanic. I have never purchased my own car before. After following this subreddit and other money-related subreddits for a few years, I have been scared straight into not buying ""too much car."" Here's where my car search has landed me, with a test drive scheduled for tomorrow afternoon:

**The Car:**

I am looking to purchase a used 2019 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited with 45k miles. Carfax says no accidents, it has had regular maintenance, and it came from Florida (hopefully means no rust). The listed price $22,326, and with estimated tax and fees it's $23,448. Kelley Blue Book says this is a ""great price,"" and $1,233 below their Fair Price calculation.

I plan to put $10k down and got pre-approved for a $14,000 loan at 6.49% for 60 months, shaking out to a car payment of $275.33 per month.

**Me:**

My gross pay is about $90k per year ($7.5k per month), and I am maxing my retirement accounts. Rent is $1,200 per month. After all taxes, insurance, and retirement contributions, my paychecks come in every two weeks at around $1,800. I have $15k in student loan debt at 4.5% interest rate, and am currently paying about $150 a month towards it.

**Conclusion:**

I loathe going into debt, but I need a car for work. To me, the math says I can afford this car. I would like a second opinion from someone who has purchased at least one car in their lifetime.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Lost $7k in My Rollover IRA Due to Vanguard’s Mistake,"I’m trying to do a backdoor Roth IRA, but ran into some issues. I had too much income to contribute directly to a Roth, so I recharacterized it to a traditional IRA. The next step is converting it to Roth, but I need to make sure my Vanguard rollover IRA has a $0 balance by year-end (I have 1,225 shares of VTSAX).

I called Vanguard to confirm the price, and they said it would be yesterday’s price. That was wrong, which I discovered later after checking with others. I tried to cancel the transaction, but couldn’t. I sold the shares at $136, missing out on about $6-7k in potential gains. I’ve learned that you don’t know the final price of selling mutual funds until after the sale.

Vanguard admitted the mistake and said they’ll fix it, but there’s an issue. I already rolled over the funds to Fidelity for 167k, and now the balance is $166k due to market downtrun. Didn't think they'll take responsibility with this. Vanguard will adjust as soon as the money reaches my account (so I'll have 1225 VTSAX again, as if the transaction never happened).

The process:

* Vanguard tried to stop the check on Friday, but it was already cashed by Fidelity. Now my balance is $166k. This steps fails.
* Vanguard will ask Fidelity to return the money. I don’t know how long that’ll take. They said it'll take 3 business days to just prep the letter.
* If above doesn't work, they'll go with reimbursement. I don't know what what this means.

If all of above doesn’t work, Vanguard will make an adjustment for the difference. I asked them to just give me adjustment, but they refused unless I go through all of the process. I asked them to speak with supervisor, but need to wait 48 hours. 

My questions:

* Should I leave the money in Fidelity and proceed with the Roth conversion?
* Should I wait for the process to finish, even if it risks missing the Roth conversion and paying taxes on the $7k roth contribution?

This is money I won’t need for 20 years.",2024-11-19 18:12:42,0.0,12.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Backdoor Roth Conversion Planning - Tax Year 2025,"I am looking for some guidance regarding Backdoor Roth conversions for my wife and I in tax year 2025 as our income will be higher than the income limits for direct Roth IRA.

I recently moved jobs and rolled my previous employers 401k into a ***new Rollover IRA (non-Roth assets)*** and my existing ***Roth IRA (Roth assets)***. I've read that you could be subject to the Pro-rata rule if you rollover 401k assets.

Another point to clarify, I created a Fidelity Traditional IRA account in preparation for next year which I'll keep empty until then when I fund it up to $7000.

So my main question is, am I in the clear because I had Fidelity spilt the assets as noted above and rolled them over into the correct buckets? Any advice or resources to review would be helpful, I want to ensure I'm doing this correct (if I haven't already screwed it up).

When I filed for taxes earlier this year, I received a notice my MAGI was too high and I needed to recharacterize to a traditional IRA; I completed the process.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Best way to set up my family for the future?,"Okay, so I'm a 27M and my wife is 28F. Our first (and probably only child) is due in 24 days. 

  
Childcare where we live is over 800/week for a newborn and as my wife's income after tax was 2000/month, we made the decision for her to quit her job. We do not have any retired family that could stay at home and look after our son either, so that wasn't feasible. 

  
As we get closer to that (tomorrow is her last day), I'm starting to panic internally about the finances. We're in a weird spot, because we're in the process of moving to a place that's cheaper, but I don't know the pricing. I make about 3500/month after taxes. If need be, I could raise that by about 200/month by not investing into my work 401k, but I'd rather not do that.

  
So our current payments are;

Mortgage 1200, HOA 150(water included), Electric 141, Gas 20, Car insurance 125, Car 440, internet 80, phones 200, security system at old house 70 (but still have 3 years left of contract, and if we break it we get hit with a 1400\~ bill at once), Wife's health insurance 450. My medical bills 33, wife's medical bills 275+. Timeshare 250/mo and maintenance 97/mo, Total 3531/month, not counting food, gas for the car or anything else. Also not counting the remaining 1300 we owe for labor/delivery/obgyn visits.  Does not count CC bills either, but those are low and just used for the occasional meal.

  
The reason we don't know how our finances are going to look is because while we're in the process of trying to get the old house to sell, we're living at my grandfathers (payed off) house that he doesn't live in. We're going to be renting it from him, with the thing being that once he passes, my mother will sign it over to us for $1. He's been helping us out by paying the utilities there currently until the end of the year; But he has not told us how much they are. He also has not told us how much he's going to charge in rent, but 500-600 / month has been thrown out there. 

  
Our savings are current at 7k. My wife will have one more check for 1k, and then I'll have two more checks before the baby is due, for another 3.4k. (First is tomorrow though, so all the bills are coming in) My boss also usually does a Christmas bonus the week of Thanksgiving, and last year it was 5k, but we're down 20% in sales so I'm not sure what this year will be.

  
The old house has some minor cosmetic damage, probably around $600 in materials would be required to fix it and that's what we've been somewhat dragging our feet about putting it on the market over. The bigger issue is the drain pipes in the master bathroom flood the living room, so the master is unusable, and repairing all of that would be 20-30k from what we've been quoted. Very much out of our budget. My step-fathers cousin is a real estate lawyer and is willing to do the closing pro-bono and my boss has a few friends that are real estate agents willing to do the sell for a lower commission percentage due to low inventory in our area. Zillow estimates the house around 190-200k, but we owe 168k on it. 

  
I'm just stressed out and don't know know what to do. We still owe another 15k on the car, but it's at a 4.9% rate. The timeshare we just got because we want to be able to travel and see the country / world with our family + it gets us massive plane discounts to visit my wife's family which lives on the other side of the country, so that's not something we can get rid of. That's 16k remaining. 

  
I'd also like to potentially put some money aside for our son so that he has money when he turns 18, and isn't just left to fend for himself like me and my wife were. 

  
Any advice would be appreciated. ",2024-10-31 16:41:08,1.0,7.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Help Refinancing Various Debts,"Hello everyone and thanks for stopping by.

I am reaching out for advice on how to tackle some various types of debt, totaling just under 35k with an average interest rate of around 20-22%. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed for quite a few months, and a mentor recommended I reach out for help and guidance here.

Little bit about me. I currently make 55k to 60 pretax or so a year. I’m living what feels like paycheck to paycheck but have never made a late payment or missed payment. Within the year, my credit card companies lowered my available credit and increased my rates to the highest variable. Due to the change in my utility percentage  my credit score is around 620-680 from over 720 this same time last year.

My question would be what would be the best option to refinance the following various debts into a manageable payment at a lower percentage rate? Personal loan? Balance transfers?

My goal would be to have one fixed payment (hopefully between 500-750 a month) at a lower percentage interest rate. I’m looking for a 3-5 year contingency plan to allow some breathing room in my month to month.

I’ve put my generalized monthly budget below for review. The monthly cost of paying the minimums is currently around $1150 a month, and I’ve never made a late payment but I’m unable to overpay to curb some of the additional interest expenses. 

Monthly Income After Tax: $3,800
Monthly Costs (car, rent, insurance): $2000
Monthly Debt Min. Obligation: $1150
Leftover for (gas, food etc): $600 a month 

Credit Card Debt: After losing my job in mid 2023 and living off my credit cards for almost an after burning through minimal savings, I have $19,000 in credit card debt. This is one three cards (Three cards total, one with 9K and two with 5k each). These cards are closer to 25%-28% interest rate.

Personal Loan: Took out a personal loan in 2021 after making a decision to pay off credit card debt post college. Currently have $10,500 @ 15% interest left to pay.

Business Debt: Started an online business end of 2022 and it did not stick after a few positive months, and have accrued $3,500 in business card debt with no current income from the business, net neutral month over month last year or so. Not profitable currently and has taken the back burner as I establish myself at my newer job. 17-24% interest.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Mortgage co. bills monthly for property tax AND state bills me for same?,"This is somewhat convoluted, so I'll try to be especially clear.

I inherited a home with a mortgage that I took over and am close to paying off. It's a fixed rate loan on a home in California. Normally I receive a refund each year for overpayment, but when that didn't arrive by September and I noticed a slight increase in the bill, I went looking.

In reviewing documents from the mortgage company (Chase), I noticed that their itemized monthly bill includes a $500+ charge for the property tax. I did some math, and over a 12 month period, it works out to be exactly the same amount the state tax bills me for the same property each year.

Does this mean I'm paying property taxes twice -- in essence, being unnecessarily double billed? Both have always requested payment in full and never indicated that the state is getting anything from my mortgage company in property taxes.

I'm not the most financially savvy to begin with, and that's been compounded by neuro damage, so I'm having a hard time sussing out what I'm looking at. Any guidance would be appreciated.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,How do I handle this shady ass car dealership before my deal is finalized? [Crossposted],"Update: It took an hour for me to get great answers thank you guys :) The comments have helped me see that the bottom line is whether I'm fully informed and happy with the deal, not who gets my money. I think I'll head back to them in person, get every detail I can, and sit on it for a second knowing what I do now. Thank you!!

--- 

So I (29F) started the purchase of a car on Friday. I left feeling proud for taking a stand on a few things and negotiating the price down before agreeing on it, but can't shake my doubts about the experience. Sorry this is so long. I YouTubed what to expect a little before I went, but was short on time. I didn't exactly go in with a diabolical plan to ruin their day.

**The first offer:** $342 monthly (\*I now know to not do this by monthly when I go back, but here is the context I had at the time) To them I was probably a slam dunk as a first time buyer. I had to look at their absolute cheapest cars due to my situation which is another thing to consider from their end. It was a vague single-page itemized invoice. The monthly price offered was handwritten - $342. No mention of interest rate. I asked, no answer. I tried considering the items on the list after they suggested they can work with me on the monthly. I've been advised not to do that but felt stuck and unsure in the moment. I tried saying I want the cost of the car lower first and then talk monthly, and there was so much going on it just kept being a later thing. Turned down gap insurance. Offered to take the cost off the car if I'd still take the insurance. Once he understood that I'm not buying the gap insurance, dude jumped away with an almost-eye roll the millisecond my sentence was finished (he was now taking care of other clients that came in and was jumping around a lot) It was hectic, 31st of the month so maybe it was just a rough day. No recollection of the total cost in this offer, but I think it was in the high 15k. The gap insurance was either $1,000 or $1,500. The way that process went was super confusing to me and I'll pay closer attention next time.

**The second offer:** $303 monthly - After some time with finance, he brought out the next offer. I should have taken a photo of the original, but off my memory alone I noticed immediately they raised the cost of another item on the list by a few hundred. There could have been more wrong with the second offer than I realized but I didn't have it in front of me and I didn't catch anything. I said ""Hmm. That number's higher."" And he was a bit caught off guard. I pointed out that X said X on the last invoice. He said sorry and took it back to finance again. I let him know I wanted to make sure the numbers are right since I don't have the old invoices to compare it to now that I know there was something to be concerned about. He didn't ever bring those out. Also no recollection of the total cost in this offer. I don't remember the out the door price on this either.

**Last offer:** I can't even remember at this point where we landed at. It's like they knew the longer they'd keep me waiting the less I'd remember about the other prices.  
Car: 2017 Chevy Bolt EV Premier - $12,499  
Trade-In: 2011 Honda CRV - $1,000 (the car is beat up cosmetically so I found it fair, $1500 rough quote on Kelly Blue Book with little details)  
The car was listed 12,499 and then after including my 1,000 trade in the out the door price became something around 14,300. I had to assume it was fair because I know my credit is bad. The monthly was then $282/mo after everything and felt good/like it was acceptable at the time. I also knew they have to make their money somewhere and I do feel bad about working folks and their commissions, and that I can't expect to be a chooser when my credit is garbage and I have no down payment. I looked unamused but said that's fair and shook his hand. I'm now realizing I forgot that included my 1,000 trade in and that the final cost is much more than I realized in the moment. (\*Learned that my credit has nothing to do with the pricing we agree on before getting to the next step, woo) (Also, the 12,499 listing price is *including* the $4k NJ EV tax rebate that counts as down payment. So I guess 16,499)

Right now, I'm thankful the deal isn't done because of my trade-in title needing to be transferred into my name from my family members' name. I think I can walk from this since I haven't put a down payment down or signed off on financing, but I did sign that vague invoice/offer proposal. There's technically a 4k down payment from the government since it was an Electric used car and there's some rebates etc for that in NJ. We also got the car VIN number added to our auto insurance policy that day which I think can be changed.

I'm not trying to get anyone fired. They replied to a recent bad Google review-gone-good saying they terminated the employee they dealt with and they don't endorse whatever it is they did that got edited out. I think it's a work culture problem that's become normalized if anything. I got an uncomfortable feeling from the Final Finance Boss too, because honestly his deal-sealing smile looked like a shit eating grin.

I'm not married to the car. I have no way of knowing how many extra fees are reasonable to expect or not.

* Go to dealer in person and talk full fine print money details + their deception before closing?
* Bail over the phone? Bail in person?
* Do I go to another dealer and potentially waste their time in an attempt to bring their offer back to Dealer 1 to get a better price?
* Do I get my phone charger back from them? Ha
* Anything I'm missing? I have no idea whether assuming that this was ""just how it is"" cost me here or if it was a common experience with a good dealer

**I want to hear from the team of people that don't want to support these guys, and those that will bite the ethical dilemma to get what's in their best interest regardless of that.**

**TLDR:** First time buyer caught dealership increasing the cost of extra items on the invoice to compensate after turning down gap insurance. Was okay with how much I talked them down to at the time and agreed before leaving, but having doubts about the experience before finalizing. 

EDIT: Adding important details I missed!

* No I don't have the final paperwork yet- they merely gave me the itemized invoice, got my signature, and I'm assuming that's just an issuing of my word more than an actual sealed deal. They would not give me the interest rates when I asked. They insisted on negotiating monthly hard and I was flustered and unsure where to take the conversation in the moment. Verbiage at one point after I denied the offers was ""What can you afford? We'll do whatever we have to do to the numbers to make it work for you"" When I asked how exactly they'd make it work it wasn't made clear and he was off to finance. (\*Note above that I've now learned this was bad, mmkay)

* I wouldn't be buying the car if I didn't have to unfortunately, if I had any cash I'd definitely be making the repairs I need to get my current car's registration back in order. My dead 2011 Honda CRV has been reliable since I got it at 157,000, now at 215,700 miles but I just can't swing it unless financing car repairs was a thing, cause I'd so rather not get into more debt. It needs at least $1,500 to $2,000 before it can get a clear inspection, registered in my name, and back on the road.
* My credit is terrible right now - 590. I know expect a buttload of interest and it's unfortunately all I can do as I've just now gotten a stable job and am just building a life that isn't paycheck to paycheck now. 
   * My utilization is 92% right now, but my history of monthly payments is 100%, no derogatory marks, credit age average 11mos (first credit card established a little over 2 years ago) with five open accounts.
* Why I'm paycheck to paycheck: I basically worked an internship for seven years at a company I loved but moved on once I developed the skills and the economy's sense of urgency in me finding a better paying job. It was a trade-off of living the dream poor while also learning skills that would benefit me long term, which some would equate to a college education. 
   * I'm still living paycheck to paycheck but am proud of my fetal $200 emergency fund right now and am trying to make a habit of learning more about finance on Youtube at this time. ",2024-06-03 00:06:13,0.0,23.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Tax preparer mixed up residencies- audit? Issues?,"
Hi, my tax preparer mixed up my residency states when he filed yesterday night 10/13.

He mixed my (actual nonresident) UT and (actual resident) MI state returns. We had been going back and forth via texts/calls and I had multiple W2s across both states which probably made things harder.

It is now showing I owe over $3,000+ penalties/interest to UT . Had it been done correctly, I would have owed $1400 to MI.

What is the chance of me being audited for this year or past years? 
-I can prove my residency here in MI 
-UT has a higher tax rate than MI so I don’t know  if states will think I’m evading taxes
-3/4 of my total federal income had UT taxes withheld because I hadn’t informed my employer I moved to MI until this year. My work is remote so I worked from home MI all year. I don’t know if that’ll make the states flag me more for review/audit.
-I didn’t itemized deductions for 2023 but for prior years, if I get audited, I’d  have to find donation receipts which are about $4,000-6000 a year.
-The IRS is fine. I don’t owe them anything.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Pro-Rata Rule Question ,"I have a random traditional IRA with about $20k in it. It was funded years ago with before tax dollars. I’m looking to add an additional $7k to this account in order to do a backdoor Roth conversion, but I know I’ll get stuck with a tax bill based on the pro-rata rule.

It seems like this would be the case every year going forward since the deductible portion of the traditional IRA is not changing.

To avoid having this annoyance every year, would it make sense to just take the tax hit and convert the $20k traditional to Roth over the next couple years? That way I’ll eventually be able to do backdoor Roth conversions every year without having to worry about the pro-rata rule?

For what it’s worth, I have other tax advantaged options (mega backdoor Roth) I could use during these few years while I’m converting my traditional IRA balance to Roth.",2024-10-03 15:33:13,0.0,5.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Should I do backdoor Roth having recharacterized from Roth to Traditional?,"Hello, this year I maxed out my Roth IRA expecting to receive tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals, but realized that due to me selling most of my stocks my MAGI would be above $122k. Due to this I recharacterized my Roth IRA contributions for this year to my Traditional IRA. After doing more research, I realize that I could perform a ""backdoor Roth"" by converting this year's contributions from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

1. Can I still convert this year's Traditional IRA contributions from Traditional to Roth, in order to receive tax benefits?
2. What tax benefits do I get by doing a roth conversion (tax-free contributions, tax-free growth, or tax-free withdrawals)?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,I'm doing a backdoor Roth IRA (but made the mistake of doing the conversion in October 2023 while only just remembering that I have a $4700 Rollover IRA sitting at Fidelity...,"So that means I pro-rata'd myself for 2023. According to everything I've now learned from White Coat Investor's site here: [https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/)

I should have turned that rollover IRA into a Roth IRA before Dec 31st of 2023. Some data points. I **contributed** $6000 to a Vanguard traditional IRA money market fund in April 2023 (for 2022) and then October of 2023 is when I did my **conversion** to the Roth IRA but looks like I was supposed to have checked to see if I had any rollover IRAs (and SEPs, etc) so that I could get rid of them by Dec 31st of 2023, I didn't have one in Vanguard but I only just realized today that I had a Rollover IRA in Fidelity. Some data points: Only I have a Rollover IRA, I don't work, and my spouse who is the breadwinner doesn't have any traditional IRAs like a rollover, SEP, etc. I do the taxes using turbotax and I haven't ever done my spouse's **conversion** yet, only mine, and only for the 2022 contribution amount. I still have the 2023 and 2024 ($6500 and $7000) contributions sitting in the traditional IRA money market since when I made them in April 2024. Going forward I will try to be more timely in the contribution to conversion step, but for now my main concern is to fix the pro-rata mistake I made.

  
WCI's site says this about my situation:

""What If You Didn't Empty the IRA?

What if you screwed this one up? Your Backdoor Roth IRA conversion step just got pro-rata'd. There is a tax bill associated with that because most of your conversion was of tax-deferred money rather than post-tax money like it was supposed to be.

The fix for this is going to vary by the individual, but the easiest fix is to simply convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now, so you end up getting all your post-tax money into that Roth IRA. Another possible fix is to figure out a way to separate your basis in that IRA, roll the tax-deferred money into a 401(k), and then convert the basis left behind in the IRA.

Do yourself a favor and just empty the darn IRA by December 31. Keep in mind that this is usually not an instantaneous process, so don't put it off until you're on holiday break at the end of the year.""

  
I don't understand how to do what he (the author, Jim Dahle) is suggesting. ""The fix for this is going to vary by the individual, but the easiest fix is to simply convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now, so you end up getting all your post-tax money into that Roth IRA. Another possible fix is to figure out a way to separate your basis in that IRA, roll the tax-deferred money into a 401(k), and then convert the basis left behind in the IRA.""

I guess the easiest fix is to convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now according to the above. So, does that just mean that I call up Fidelity and convert the $4700 Rollover IRA to a Fidelity Roth IRA? And then what do I do? How do I correct things now that I made that pro-rata mistake? Can I undo the conversion that I did last October or do I need to file some sort of tax correction form? If I do nothing then I think I’m taxed extra for my pro-rats error, but I’m pretty sure there is a way to correct the error?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"Small 401k withdrawal after age 59 1/2, does this sound sensible ?","I'm past the age of 59 1/2 and still working full-time, and expect to keep working until I'm at least 67 before considering retirement.   I've got a 401k balance close to 670k and a pension balance around 200k.   My salary is 160k annually.   I've recently reduced my 401k withholding to 0% to help with cashflow (see below) which is painful since I'm missing out on the 6% company match at this point.   The balance on the 401k account has risen 64k so far in 2024, and shows an annualized rate of return of \~5% since 2021.

Our primary residence has a value of around $250k, with about $96k still owed, so roughly $150k in equity.

We've recently bought a second home, from an elderly in-law who lives on social security and was about to lose the family home because he couldn't afford to maintain it or pay taxes.   Since we were helping him stay in the home, and it was in poor repair, we bought it for a low price, and have been fixing it up.   He in turn pays a token amount of rent to fit his SSA budget.  This home also is worth about $250k, and we have a mortgage of roughly 100k on it since we bought for a low price.   So again, about $150k in equity.

Of course we're not going to see the benefit of any of that home equity for several years at least, most likely.

All the initial purchase costs on the second home, plus the necessary immediate expenses for a new roof, driveway, interior renovation, porch rebuild, kitchen & bath fixes, etc  have been a strain of course, and now I have some credit balances that have high rates and are severely restricting cashflow each month.   It's to the point that as soon as I get paid I just turn around and send nearly all of it toward credit balance(s).  But that's going to take a looong time to pay down, given the tight cashflow and high rates.   Plus it leaves me little liquid cash on hand in case of emergencies.

Three of the outstanding credit balances have APR that's over 8.5%, with a total balance for those accounts around $25k.   There are two other balances outstanding, but they have rates under 3.5%, so I was going to leave them alone.  Two of the balances are 401k loans, which precludes the possibility of taking out a \*new\* 401k loan at this point.  I also wanted to avoid anything like a HELOC on one of the properties, since that's going to have a high rate these days, and just moves the balance(s) somewhere else, and still needing to be paid off somehow.

What I'm considering is taking a 401k withdrawal of $25k (plus some to cover taxes) to pay off the three high-rate balances.   My understanding is that given my age, there won't be a 10% penalty, though there would still be regular income taxes on any withdrawn amount.    

This would free up about $3000 in cashflow each month since I'm currently sending \*big\* payments to the credit card to try to get it down.  This would also allow me to put my 401k withholding back to 6% (or more) to help my 401k balance recover and regain the company match.

The downsides of course, are the lost growth in the 401k for the $25k withdrawal, plus the taxes paid on the withdrawal amount.

Does this seem like a reasonable move ?    Thanks for input!",2024-08-29 14:33:33,2.0,6.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Purchasing My Parents a House & Renting It Back to Them,"Hello All,

Hello, everyone; I'm considering a scenario involving property investment and early inheritance, and I'd love to get your insights. I see this scenario as generally positive or worst-case neutral. I would like my internet friends to tell me differently if needed!  **Note:  I would love feedback both for me AND my parents.  The goal is it is a good/neutral deal for me and for them.**

**Scenario**: My 70 YO parents currently own a property in the USA.  They are retired and would now like to move home to the UK.  I also live in the USA and, coincidentally, have been interested in purchasing a property in the UK to rent out.  While they planned to buy a place themselves, *we have recently discussed an idea in which I buy the property using some early inheritance gifted from their existing house sale.*

I found some threads with this scenario, but no threads that had the added factor of early inheritance.  

**Financial Commentary:**

* I have no debt, 1M NW, no property, \~320k Annual Income.  (GF makes similar). 
* Outgoings around \~90k
* Early inheritance would be around 150K USD used for downpayment
* House would be around 450K USD
* On initial research, the early inheritance would not need to be taxed if parents fill a form in and use it as part of their total lifetime gift, allowance

**Estate Commentary:**

* Their estate is to go 4 other places.   The plan would modify their will to share anything they have with the remaining 3 people, and I would only get any variance left after the $150k early inheritance.  (I.e., the house would not need to be sold as this would be 100% mine).

**Family Dynamics:**

* My parents have good financial literacy (Bogleheads etc., helped me form good habits)
* They have never asked for any $, nor did they propose this  

**My conclusions as Someone who has never bought a house before:**

* Pro:  I diversify some of my NW away from the stock market.
* Pro:  I own a house (which I would like), and have reliable ""tenants"", no property management company
* Pro: I like the idea of potentially living in the UK again or moving back, and so this is an asset in an area I like for the future (it's my home village)
* Pro:  Parents get more liquidity from their existing home sale and more liquidity by paying a lower monthly payment.  This means they get more money to do more fun things (travel, etc.)
* Pro:  Parents, as they are on fixed income, have to worry less about major repairs
* Pro: Parents may be able to afford a little bit more home than without me in on the deal
* Cons: I will have to pay a premium (Expat Mortgage for UK as a US resident, Buy to Let Mortgage Premium, Forex Costs, etc.)
* Cons: If they want to move house after X years or return to the USA, this would complicate things (my biggest concern).
* Cons:  Foreign asset likely complicates my US Tax.
* Cons:  If something happens to me, it could be of risk to them.  (I would plan to modify my own will)
* Cons:  I could potentially generate more income over the life of the mortgage with other tenants and keep rental prices in line with market trends.  (To me, this is an acceptable con because if my parents get a happier last years, it is worth it, and I see it as me paying them back (partially) for the support I got growing up) 

I have no explicit plans for my life right now. My girlfriend and I assume we would want to buy in the USA in the next few years, but with our current incomes plus this new concept of early inheritance, we think we could accomplish both. 

Am I missing anything? My parents and I think this can help all parties achieve our general goals.

As this is a 500k decision, hoping to get some more opinions!

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,What to do with old roth IRA and next steps/personal feelings about ethically investing,"Hello! As the title says I (F26) am in need of some advice with financial planning. I work a job that pays about $46,000 pre tax (about 34,740 post tax) per year in a fairly LOC location in the US, and live with my mom as I take care of her and help her with transportation. Feel free to skip to the last two paragraphs as it’s what I’m actually stuck with, but I figured it may be helpful to provide a mini financial audit for background. I have a love for run on sentences and long paragraphs so there is a TLDR at the end!

Monthly Expenses

Food- a little less than $400 a month for 2 people

Gas – I budget for $65 a month, it’s usually around 45-60

Eating out, misc- about 180-200 a month

Bills- phone plan, car insurance, property taxes, utilities, they come out to maybe 590-617 a month.

Dental and medical insurance is through my job, all together it’s $26 a month

My car was paid off in cash, and my mom refuses to let me pay anything for housing other than utilities and taxes.

Assets

I have about 30k I put down to buy our house, we bought it from our landlord/family friend at no interest rate, we settled on 160k I think Zillow has it around 220k now although I do think that in the coming years we’ll need to fix a lot of things.

An emergency savings account which also includes categories for auto expenses, travel, and possible future schooling funds in a credit union, parts of this is in a CD ladder (one at 5.006%, the other at 4.9%), and parts are in a checking account at my credit union that has an APY of 4%. In total, all of this is about 45k. Might add another CD to this depending on what folks advise.

I have an FSA through my job for $250 a year, mostly just for OTC stuff, sunscreen, dental cleanings, etc.

I also have about 8k in a state pension, it is employee matched but I’m not yet vested, it’s still another 4 years to become vested or if I turn 65.

I have about 1k in Acorns, I set this up a couple years ago in college when it was only $1 each month, but lately I’ve been wondering if it’s worth paying $30 a year for it but it helps me to passively invest.

Lastly, and the reason I’m making this post, I have an old roth 401k from an internship years ago, I totally forgot about it and 3 years ago tried to log in to the company it was rolled over into (Inspira Financial- used to be Millenium Trust Company, see google reviews for my hesitancy to stay with them) and while waiting for a response to help me log in, it again slipped my mind. It had about $600+ but after finally remembering about it, I was able to finally log in this week and after fees ( I think?) it’s now about $480.

Logically, I think at this point I should set up another roth IRA and just rollover the aforementioned IRA into another account that I have a bit more trust in for the tax benefits and starting young. At the same time, I’m pretty hesitant about putting money into retirement accounts that I can’t pull money from easily. I grew up not that wealthy and I suspect that as my mom gets older she’ll have more medical costs, so there’s something in me that wants to keep money as liquid as I can. I am a bit risk averse and frankly not sure about the ethics of investing in the market (not here to argue about that as I know it’s nuanced, just explaining!). A part of me just wants to pull the money out of the old roth ira out and put it in a CD or hysa (my banking direct?) and just take the fees and tax but I also know that might be dumb and maybe I should just keep it where it is (I did read the flowchart that confirms it’s dumb, but, if I understand it correctly, the fees I’d pay for cashing out vs rolling it over into another ira has a difference of about $85 since I’m still in a lower tax bracket and it’s not a huge amount?) . I guess I just need someone to look this over and either smack my head and call me an idiot or some advice about what they recommend for next steps. I’m setting up an appointment with the investment team at my local credit union soon but figured it couldn’t hurt to see what the internet thinks about my financial choices, much appreciated!

TLDR: Trying to figure out what to do with an old roth IRA with high fees that was rolled over from an internship, and if you have any advice for people who are wary about “ethically investing”, whatever that means, would appreciate that also.",2024-07-05 19:27:13,2.0,9.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"Employer changed payroll companies and caused an IRS mess at the federal level.  It got sorted, but I've lost the forms and need them now for a state review.  ","tl;dr - IRS found some issues, sent me a sheet that said ""this is what you filed versus this is what was sent to us - please pay the difference that we've calculated"".  I paid, lost the sheet, and now the *state* is asking if I owe them anything and I can't figure out how to proceed.  

The longer version: in 2021, we switched payroll providers mid-year, and in addition to the proper W2 being sent to the IRS, the half-year one from the first company also got sent.  So in 2023, I got a letter from the IRS saying ""hey, what's with this unreported W2 from '21?""

I was able to fix it, but in the process of this whole thing, the IRS saw that I had forgotten to submit a form from a small brokerage account that I'd completely forgotten about - so they sent me a sheet with a breakdown of what I filed versus what they discovered, and I paid it off based on that.  Got a receipt that I was all set.

Except now, over a year later, my state audit department has sent me a letter saying ""hey, the IRS sent us an amended return - if you owe us anything, please file.  If you don't, disregard"".  I have a feeling I do owe *something*, but here's the problem: I cannot, for the life of me, find the documents that the IRS sent last year.  And now, I can't even figure out what the form would have been called that the IRS sent me, so I can't even attempt to look it up, let alone request a new copy.  I'm completely lost as to how to proceed.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Question about Backdoor ROTH conversion after rolling over an old IRA,"My income increased this year to the point where I will no longer be able to contribute to a Roth IRA, so I started making monthly contributions to a Traditional IRA at Fidelity with the intention of doing a backdoor conversion at EOY. I know it's not the best way to go about it, but I didn't have enough liquid cash to do it all in one go without dipping into my emergency fund.

Last month I made the absentminded decision to consolidate my retirement accounts and rolled Roth and Traditional IRAs that I had at another brokerage into Fidelity as well, not considering how this might affect my backdoor conversion plans. Now I have about $20k in the account, whereas I know the ideal situation is to have $0 after the conversion.

What would be the best way for me to correct this so that I can do the backdoor without eating a ton in taxes due to pro-rata complications? Or is there nothing I can do except pay up?

Thanks in advance for the feedback. I'm a late bloomer when it comes to finances and trying to get caught up has been a priority for me the last 2 years.",2024-06-14 22:20:40,0.0,9.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"My 2024 Roth IRA contributions might be invalid, what to do? ","
So I made the full $7000 Roth IRA contribution for 2024 a few months ago.  I projected my and my wife’s combined income for the year and we had enough deductions to get us below the $230k MAGI threshold allowed to make the full Roth IRA contribution. 

Well, my wife recently got a re-rate at work (she’s an RN and they I ncreased her rate by $13/hr after she cleared her 90 day probationary period) and they retroactively paid out the pay difference dating back to the beginning of the year. This effectively adds +$25k to our income projections.  To help offset, we raised my wife’s 401k contributions (she will now max out for 2024) but this still puts us squarely out of reach of contributing directly to a Roth IRA.  A good problem to have, I supposed. 

So now my question is, what do I do now with the $7000 Roth IRA contribution?

I’ve read that I can recategorize my Roth IRA contributions to a non-deductible traditional IRA contribution because the recategorization is occurring within the same tax year.  Is this true?  (The contribution would have to be non-deductible because we’re both covered by 401k plans at work and exceed income level limits to make deductible contributions) 

I was already resigned to the fact that I would need to do back door Roth conversions starting next year, but I guess maybe I need to start this year?

I created a Rollover IRA account with Fidelity that would serve as a consolidation account for all my traditional tax-deferred IRAs I have (I.e Schwab, Vanguard, etc) in preparation for a Roth conversion of those funds. 

Is the following plan of attack sound?  (Haven’t done this before so not sure if it works)

1) Reclassify 2024 Roth IRA contribution to non-deductible Traditional IRA contribution 
2) Consoldiate all other existing tax-deferred Traditional IRAs into one account (with Fidelity) 
3) Convert tax-deferred Traditional IRA funds to Roth IRA (and pay tax bill when filing 2024 taxes).  
4) Convert 2024 non-deductible Traditional IRA contribution to Roth IRA via backdoor.  

Would the above plan prevent pro-rata taxation for my 2024 contributions since those were made with post-tax money?  If not, what steps would I need to take to prevent double taxation on those contributions.  

Paying the taxes on the Roth conversion would sting but we also just bought a house, so the income tax deductions from Mortgage Interest and Property taxes will help offset.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Need help understanding tax implications of backdoor Roth IRA from messy Rollover IRA,"Originally, I made this Rollover IRA from some state related retirement money.  Then I added money thinking it was a Roth IRA before fixing things.  Now I want to backdoor it but I can't quite understand the tax implications at this point.

Originally in 2020: $4,370.01 from a rollover

2021: I added $6k to the Rollover IRA (didn't claim it as a deduction)

2022: I added $6k to the Rollover IRA (didn't claim it as a deduction)

2023: Maxed out Roth IRA

2024: I maxed out the Roth IRA, realized my income put me in the partial contribution category, so I did a recharacterization.  Vanguard shows $5,691.42 for the recharacterization.

It now has $26,983.40 in it.  I wanted to backdoor Roth IRA this, but the more I read about what to do, the more I got super confused on it.  I read something about pro rata and then got even more confused because at this point I'm definitely far beyond the ""put $X in it and rollover the entire thing"".  It's been there for a while earning gains and also has the original rollover.

So, if I rolled it over, what would happen?  I'd pay taxes on all the gains?  What would that be it or is there more that I'm missing?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",2024-02-24 19:30:46,0.0,15.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,How withholding works with a few (dozen) examples,"Tax withholding can get complicated so here is an attempt to explain how it works, using different scenarios. All examples using 2024 figures, cover federal taxes only (states often mimic the older federal system with allowances, unfortunately), and [the spreadsheet used for screenshots is archived here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vu7Nb1PQP8Hbox5vrsj_xgRqRrBn5ugFS22QKOTVd50/copy) (it will ask you to make a copy) and [the current W-4 is here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf).


## How withholding works
An [image showing the steps of withholding is here](https://i.imgur.com/w3mUEuZ.png) but it's just:

* The IRS tells your employer to take your income subject to tax (gross income minus pre-tax deductions)  
* Multiply by total pay periods that year (26, e.g.)
* Add or subtract anything you put in for W-4 Other Income or W-4 Deductions  
* Subtract the standard deduction  
* Compute tax on that (10% on the first $11,600, 12% on the next... etc.)^1  
* Subtract the amount you had for credits in W-4 Step 3   
* Divide by the number of pay periods  
* Add the amount in W-4 Extra withholding


^1 For reference, tax brackets based on total income, versus subtracting out standard deduction you commonly see, is below. This makes a bit easier to understand taxes in my opinion.

|Single|Married|Rate
|:--|:--|:--
|$0|$0|0%
|$14,600|$29,200|10%
|$26,200|$52,400|12%
|$61,750|$123,500|22%
|$115,125|$230,250|24%


**The four levers of the W-4**

The W-4 has four boxes for you to adjust withholding (outside of filing status and Step 2's handling of multiple jobs). You can move the amount you have withheld by raising or lowering your assumed annualized income, or by raising or lowering your withholding, dollar for dollar. Note when withholding goes *up* you net paycheck amount goes *down*, but your refund goes *up* (or amount owe goes *down*).


|Amt withheld|Assumed Income|Withholding $ for $
|:--|:--|:--
|Increases|Other Income (4a)|Extra withholding (4c)
|Decreases|Deductions (4b) |Dep's/credits (3)

|Item|Time period
|:--|:--
|Dep's/credits (3)|Annual
|Other Income (4a)|Annual
|Deductions (4b)|Annual
|Extra withholding (4c)|Per pay period

So in other words, say your income puts you in the 22% marginal bracket, meaning an extra $100 will cause tax to go up $22. Putting $100 in Other Income (4a) will cause withholding to go *up* $22/(pay periods), in Deductions (4b) will cause withholding to go *down* $22/(pay periods). Putting $100 in Credits (3) causes $100 less to be withheld over the year. Putting $100 in Extra withholding (4c) will cause $100 to be withheld every single paycheck.

----
## Basic Examples

Say Alexis has a salary of $100,000, paid bi-weekly (26× a year). 

[Example Simple](https://i.imgur.com/Y0MoUbC.png) is just $100,000, Single. Tax computation if you don't trust me [is here] or [paycheckcity](https://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary) is a good source, but is $13,841. Hence $532.35 withheld 26 times. And note in the screenshots, boxes with fill colors and dashed borders are inputs, the rest is computed.

[Example Simple Pretax](https://i.imgur.com/fbpOInN.png) shows how pre-tax deductions lower withholding, but don't interfere with withholding accuracy. Alexis's $2,600 in deductions is $100 per bi-weekly paycheck. Alexis is in the 22% tax bracket, so that's $22 less withheld per paycheck. Annually, $2,600×22% = $572 less tax. $13,841 ([Example Simple]((https://i.imgur.com/Y0MoUbC.png))) minus $572 is $13,269.

[Example Simple Joint](https://i.imgur.com/TakFdor.png) shows how filing status alone also doesn't mess up withholding accuracy. Tax is lower for Married (filing joint, in all these examples), but the withholding algorithm knows this and computes tax on the Joint tables vs Single depending on what you put in Step 1 of the W-4.


**Other Income & Deductions**

Steps 4a & 4b (Other Income & Deductions) on the W-4 cover alternations to your work's annualized income. 

[Example Extra Income](https://i.imgur.com/OPDsU2E.png) shows what happens if Alexis gets $300 in extra, un-withheld income, like bank interest. Her tax goes up $300×22% = $66.  [Example Extra Income Fixed](https://i.imgur.com/TDURRAB.png) shows how putting $300 in Other Income (4a) means she doesn't need to do that math -- it's taken care of in the algorithm. Even if her extra income passed a tax bracket, it's no issue. The algorithm will just lump Other Income with the rest of her income just how the 1040 does.

[Example Deduction](https://i.imgur.com/VJZ3BEI.png) shows the opposite -- if Alexis puts $7,000 to her IRA, she would normally get 22% of that ($1,540) back. But she can put $7,000 into Deductions (4b) to lower her withholding (by $1,540/26 per paycheck) to get paid that money during the year which we see in [Example Deduction fixed](https://i.imgur.com/N9gMlPS.png). 

Note that your employer's instructions tell them to assume you take the standard deduction. If you itemize, only put the amount *over* the standard deduction in Deductions.

[Example Itemize](https://i.imgur.com/ZMYvczt.png) shows why: if Alexis's Schedule A total is $1,000 more than her standard deduction, she saves $220 on taxes. But she only should add $1,000 in Deductions to even it out as we see in [Example Itemized fixed](https://i.imgur.com/8UkzUOd.png) (see W-4 Deductions Worksheet).

**Extra Withholding**

Extra withholding is needed when you deal with the ""Other taxes"" on the 1040, usually reserved for high-income earners or people who have to pay penalties for early withdrawals or who owe from previous years. It's also often used as a buffer to make sure you don't owe. For example, if you don't know your bank interest or capital gains, you can put a value here to help keep from owing.

[Example Extra withholding](https://i.imgur.com/ScbPhfU.png) shows how a high-income earner has to pay an Additional Medicare Tax. The $540 in extra tax is dealt with $540/26 into Extra withholding. Note this box (4c) unlike the others (Step 3, 4a, 4b) works per paycheck instead of using annual figures. 


**Credits**

The final of the four boxes we can alter on W-4, Step 3, is for credits. It's labelled Claim
Dependent and Other Credits, so note it's for all credits like educational credits or buying an EV.

[Example Credits](https://i.imgur.com/UMbjBrB.png) shows a simple credit -- if Alexis gets a $2,500 credit, she can put $2,500 in Step 3 and she'll have $2,500/26 less withheld per paycheck.

**Non-refundable credits** -- treat as all other credits

A non-refundable credit will subtract from your tax liability but -- unlike a refundable credit -- won't cause your tax liability to go below $0 (and thankfully, refundable credits are subtracted after non-refundable credits).

[Example non-refundable credit, full](https://i.imgur.com/XGZNisi.png) shows how a non-refundable credit on Step 3 works fine if the taxpayer has the income to support it. If Alexis (whose tax is over $13,000) buys a Tesla and gets the $7,500 EV credit, withholding works with Step 3 as well as always.

[Example non-refundable credit, partial](https://i.imgur.com/ma4tG20.png) shows how a non-refundable credit also isn't a problem with income that doesn't have enough tax to take full advantage. In this case, with a lower income, some of the $7,500 is unused. Yet with $7,500 in Step 3, the taxpayer's income went to $0; and with a tax liability of $0 after the credit, things work out.

In other words, put your non-credits in Step 3 and don't worry if you take full advantage. And refundable credits don't have this issue, either, since they let tax go <$0.

## More Advanced Examples

**Bonuses**

Bonuses are *taxed* just as ordinary income but *withholding* rules your employer follows are different. Note one-off or infrequent bonuses should have a flat 22% withheld. The other method of withholding is out of scope of this post.

[Example Bonus](https://i.imgur.com/08A34aF.png) shows if Alexis gets a $10,000 bonus, it add $2,200 to her tax. Her employer kept $2,200 back, so there's nothing to do. 

[Example Bonus, high income](https://i.imgur.com/Vu9BuB2.png) shows what happens at higher incomes or higher bonuses (it's all added together). Her $16,125 bonus now fills up the rest of the 22% bracket, and (a convenient!) $1,000 is going to be taxed at 24%. Since the whole bonus is withheld at 22% per regulation, she's going to owe 24%-22%=2% of $1,000, or $20. Putting $1 in Extra withholding will address this.

[Example Bonus, low income](https://i.imgur.com/vdacIX6.png) shows what happens at lower incomes. If Alexis makes $50,000/yr, that's in the 12% bracket. So her 22% withholding on $10,000 means she's getting (22%-12%)×$1,000 = $100 back in a refund. She can correct this by claiming he shas a $100 credit, so $100 in Step 3 in [Example Bonus, low fixed](https://i.imgur.com/IdTl7YL.png)


**Self employment**

Self-employment can get complicated, so for [Example Self Employment](https://i.imgur.com/OkjQ8TX.png) let's zero some things out, but we'll keep the $100,000 in Alexis's base job. She decides to do side gigs, expecting to clear $10,000 in profit (gross income minus deductions) by the end of the year. She's going to need to pay both income tax, but also self-employment tax, which is about twice the 6.2%+1.45% FICA tax that employees pay for Social Security and Medicare.

So $10,000 means $1,413 in self-employment tax. Divide by 26 to put $54 in Extra withholding. Now half of that is deductible, so we have $707 taken off her income (even without itemizing, this is called an *adjustment*), so we need $707 in Deductions. And thanks to something called QBI deduction (through 2025), her $10,000 gets discounted 20%, so that's $8,000 in Other Income. Putting all three items in the W-4 results in near-perfect withholding (amount due is rounding error from Extra withholding).

----
## Multiple Jobs

For a few reasons, the W-4 does not communicate information about other jobs to your employer. In other words, the W-4/employer instructions assumes you only have one job, so you need to adjust other boxes to compensate. Failing to do so is common, and results in money owed.

[Example Multiple Unchecked](https://i.imgur.com/ArXxvPI.png), a complicated one for those curious, shows why multiple jobs can mess up withholding. Each employer, acting as they are your only employer, subtracts the standard deduction from your annualized wages and starts at 10% for dollars above that. But because income stacks, one of those jobs needs to withhold more.

Step 2 on the W-4 deals with multiple jobs and you pick only one option:  

* 2a is the online withholding calculator. It's out of scope for this long-enough post.
* 2b is the Multiple Jobs Worksheet 
* 2c is the Two Jobs Checkbox which works great if incomes are similar between two jobs

All options result in updating *all* W-4's. I offer simple solutions that don't in the **Part time** section below; but for full-time jobs, 2a-2c is better.

**Multiple Jobs: The Two Jobs Checkbox (withhold as Single option)**

Say Alexis gets married and her spouse also makes $100,000. They can both select Married Filing Joint on the W-4 and check the Two Jobs/2c checkbox, which says it's a good choice *if* the two jobs are within ½ of each other (so if one job is $100k, the other should be $50k-$200k). This is the same as the ""Married, but withhold at the higher Single rate"" checkbox on pre-2020 W-4's. In fact, it's the same math as if Alexis and her spouse selected Single and left 2c unchecked, thanks to the brackets for Joint being double that of Single (up to a high income anyway).

[Example 2c checkbox, working](https://i.imgur.com/czLfxJp.png) shows how well the 2c checkbox works for two jobs of similar incomes. And it doesn't have to be for married couples, it works on Single earners as well (it essentially tells the employer to withhold half of what it normally would)

[Example 2c checkbox, bad](https://i.imgur.com/E17559d.png) shows how the 2c checkbox fails if the incomes are different. The guidance about ""half the other income"" on the W-4 is good advice, but this shows what really matters is if each job is in the same Single bracket (accounting for the standard deduction). Some of Alexis's income was withheld at 22% when it will be taxed at 12% when filing Joint as her spouse had extra ""ceiling"" to fill up in 12%.


**Multiple Jobs: the W-4 Multiple Jobs Worksheet (""MJW"")**

[Example MJW Intro](https://i.imgur.com/dXvDRGt.png) shows a candidate for the Multiple Jobs Worksheet,  because the incomes are different (although note the Job 1 income is over $110,000, the last column the Worksheet uses). It works by looking up the two jobs on a W-4 table to get a figure, then dividing that figure by number of pay periods (really you should divide by number of pay periods *left* in the year) and putting that into Extra withholding. It essentially makes up for the fact that both jobs are subtracting out the standard deduction from their incomes.

The Multiple Job Worksheet works, but note the figures in the W-4 table are biased towards giving refunds. Taxpayers are generally happier getting refunds, and the IRS certainly doesn't mind not having to collect amounts owed.

[Example MJW high](https://i.imgur.com/2D1oWWd.png) shows the bias in a worst-case scenario -- if your incomes are both towards the bottom end of a column or row value (like $X0,000), it can result in very high refunds, which really means you had too much withheld from your paychecks.

[Example MJW low](https://i.imgur.com/52wmiuU.png) shows the opposite -- with values on the high end of column/row values (like $X9,000) you get more accurate withholding and may even owe a little bit.

**Multiple Jobs: Assigning credits to the higher income**

Whenever you enter values for Deductions or Credits (steps 4b and 3, respectively) it may not matter on whose W-4 you put them on, but it's safer to put them on the W-4 with the higher-paying job. This is because you want there to be enough ""room"" in the normal withholding to absorb the amount the withholding will go down. For example, if a credit normally means $500 less withheld per paycheck, you want a job that withholds at least $500 without that credit. Since withholding can't go below $0, it would be inaccurate otherwise.

[Example MJW No Kids](https://i.imgur.com/ukdrrbi.png) shows two jobs with $0 owed or due with the Multiple Jobs Worksheet (Job 2 income is just what happens to get $0 result with the $99,000 Job 1 income). If the couple has/expects a child by 12/31, they will want to add a $2,000 Child Tax Credit (and you want this for the full year, credits are not pro-rated by months). 

[Example Credit assigned to high income](https://i.imgur.com/JWAksvM.png) shows how a credit assigned to the higher income works fine.

[Example Credit assigned to low income](https://i.imgur.com/xIsWLdl.png) switches Job 1 and Job 2 incomes and shows how a credit assigned to the lower income can cause issues. Job 2 only had $792 withheld over the year, so a $2,000 CTC causes a $2,000-$792 refund.

----
## Part-time, seasonal, or not full year work

If you have part-time or seasonal work, or really any work where paychecks aren't similar the whole year, the W-4 can be very inaccurate, because the W-4 assumes you make the same amount each and every pay period for the full year. But there are easy solutions (easier than the [IRS withholding calculator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) which you can always use)

**With a full-time job**

[Example Main and Part-time job](https://i.imgur.com/nxP5baA.png) shows what to do if you have a full-time job, and you (or even a spouse) has part-time work: figure your total income for part-time work and put that in the main job's Other Income (4a). This job now handles all withholding, and now you just need to set the part time job(s) to $0 withholding. You can do this by marking the ""Exempt..."" box on those W-4's, or putting a large number, say $15,000 into Step 3. This works because a Single filer needs over $100,000 to have a tax of >$15,000.

**With only part-time work**

[Example Part-time job](https://i.imgur.com/ZnZcu65.png) shows what to do if you don't have a full-time job. For a part-time job, you can:

1) Estimate your total income for the year  
2) Use any online calculator to estimate your tax due on that income (note some calculators ask for ""taxable income""; if so, subtract the standard deduction from step 1!)  
3) Divide that number by the total number of paychecks you expect to receive that year  
4) Put that number in Extra withholding (4c)  
5) Put a large number like $15,000 in Step 3 to make sure that the number you put in Extra withholding is the *only* amount withheld.

If you have multiple part-time jobs, you can do the same as above, but the math gets tricky -- the whole reason the W-4 fails with multiple jobs is not accounting for the fact income stacks. So if you have a second job, figure its tax *on top* of previous jobs.

[Example multiple Part-time jobs](https://i.imgur.com/yXpQorZ.png) shows how this can be done. Forgive the very simple numbers, it's to help illustrate the process. Using online tax estimators can help you figure the tax on Job 1, and then just add in Job 2's income, take the increase in tax, and use that for Job 2's basis. So `$Job_1_tax/number_of_paychecks` goes into Job 1's Extra withholding. Then `($Job_2_tax-$Job_1_tax)/number_of_paychecks_job_2` goes into Job 2's Extra withholding.


----

**A note about varying pay**

If your paychecks vary, then this will generally result in over-withholding (a refund). To see why, imagine there was just a $10,000 standard deduction and a flat 10% tax on everything else. Taxes on $60,000 would be 10% of $50,000 or $5,000. Taxes on $120,000 would therefore be $11,000. So we see tax on 2N is *more* than twice the tax on N. This is true for our actual tax brackets (progressive taxation)

Now if we assume perfect withholding, if you make $N one pay period, and $2N the other, withholding won't be based on 1½×N. The $2N paycheck *over*-withheld more than the $N paycheck *under*-withheld, so this means you had a bit too much taken out; hence a refund. Fixing this is very difficult, so you may want to use the [IRS withholding calculator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) or just enter a value in Step 3 (Credits).",2024-03-21 13:25:48,27.0,8.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Looking to take over parent's mortgage,"Hello,   
I have been discussing taking over my parent's mortgage but am getting a bit lost in the weeds during the process. I figured I would reach out to you personal finance gurus to see if anyone could help point me in the right direction!

So the situation is, my parents currently have a mortgage (sub 300k) which they have paid roughly 30% of the principal on. They are looking to move and we would like to keep the house in the family. The tentative agreement we have discussed is I pay them a lump sum for what they have into the mortgage (\~30%), then simply take over the monthly mortgage payment as is.   
The major pro of this method for me is the current mortgage is at a much lower interest rate than is available today, so I would like to avoid refinancing/taking out another mortgage if possible.   
Another concern we have with the situation is that my parents are getting up in age, and we would like to have the transfer be as smooth as possible if anything unfortunate happens (avoid probate).  
We have looked into trusts, joint tenant options, and contracts, but as the mortgage is still outstanding it seems to complicate things.

Now on to the questions,  
What is the best way to structure this transfer to retain the current mortgage payments that would offer both of us a bit more security than a handshake deal? Draft up our own contract and sign it with the terms listed above?  
  
Is a trust(living, revocable, irrevocable?) a good option?  
  
Should we add my name to the deed/draft a new deed to the home?  
  
Since we are ""paying"" off the mortgage (in their name) will we still be hit with capitol gains tax? Would it matter since the house is around the exemption value?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"ELI5: ROTH, MAGI, Recharacterization, Backdoor","At the start of 2023, I began making significantly more money and while doing my taxes I realized that this put our MAGI into a heavily reduced ROTH contribution limit area. However, we both had already contributed the $6500 limit to our ROTH accounts.

From what I am reading it seems the recommendation is to recharacterize to an IRA, then backdoor it back into ROTH. Is that correct? If so, this is where I might need the ELI5. Unless it really is as easy as: Recharacterize ROTH overage to IRA, rollover IRA amount to ROTH within 60 days?

If that is the case, here are our accounts:Me: ROTHSpouse: Rollover IRA (from prior employer retirement), ROTH

For me, do I recharacterize my excess ROTH contribution to a newly opened IRA then within 60 days rollover the full amount back to my ROTH?

For my spouse, do we recharacterize to their Rollover IRA or a NEW IRA before following the same process of rolling over the excess contribution back to her ROTH?

This is all new to me, so I appreciate any information that can be provided.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Roth IRA Contribution 411 - Guide,"It is that time of year again where you can contribute to your Roth IRA either for 2024 or for 2023 (Until April 15th).  Roth IRAs are an excellent way of building wealth for retirement. As a lot of people are dealing with this now I thought I might take a crack at a guide as I feel like I have experienced most of the variations of how to contribute myself.  I welcome any critiques or comments if I missed any important details or misstated anything so that I can correct it in edit.  


For all the variations i'll give step by step instructions for you will first of course need to have a Roth IRA open.  I have mine in Vanguard but any of the major brokerages allow you to open an IRA account and its quite straightforward to do that.  Different brokerages will have different steps on opening the account so wont write a guide for that but if you need help the brokerage can walk you through it.

  
**Standard contribution (all most people will have to deal with)**

You can contribute direct to a Roth IRA provided two things:  
1. You have earned income in that tax year that is at least as much as your contribution amount.  Note that things like dividends are NOT earned income.  If you don't have sufficient earned income you cannot contribute to a Roth at all. Note if you are married you can contribute to a Roth for your spouse even if your spouse does not have earned income for the year as long as you have sufficient earned income.  
2. Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is below the income limit for direct contributions in that tax year.  Can find the limits here: [https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits](https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits). Can learn about MAGI here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp).  If you are above the MAGI limit you cannot contribute to a Roth directly (see Backdoor Roth).  Note there is a phaseout that goes from full contribution to lower contribution to no contribution but it is pretty narrow so in most cases you are either going to be able to contribute directly or not.

3. Come tax time there is no need to declare Roth IRA contributions as they are not deductible

Once you are clear that you can contribute to a Roth you can transfer funds from your bank account directly into your Roth account at your brokerage.  You will be given the option to contribute for the tax year you are in (so right now 2024) or the previous tax year provided it is before the filing date of April 15th). You can do both up to the contribution limits for those tax years. Given the money has already been taxed there are no tax implications for doing this.  When the money is transferred it will typically arrive in what is known as a ""settlement account"" which is typically a money market fund that makes minimal annual interest.  Chances are you are going to want to actually invest this money so you will need to then go into your Roth IRA and select an investment to purchase using the money within your Roth settlement fund.  Once you have an investment you are bought into inside your Roth future contributions can be made towards that investment directly (dependent on the brokerage).  


**Backdoor Roth (for high income earners)**  
If your income is above the MAGI limit for that tax year you wont be able to directly contribute to a Roth...but there is a simple workaround.  To do this you will need to have both a Roth IRA account AND a Traditional IRA account.  The simplest way is to have these accounts in the same brokerage but that isn't strictly necessary.  The traditional IRA should have no funds inside of it.  Note that all open Traditional IRA accounts are essentially considered to be one account so if you do have a Traditional IRA in your name with money invested in it and you open a second Traditional IRA that does not have investments that does not solve the issue.  As to why it is important for your Traditional IRA to be empty see what is known as the pro rata rule [https://smartasset.com/retirement/a-guide-to-the-pro-rata-rule-and-roth-iras](https://smartasset.com/retirement/a-guide-to-the-pro-rata-rule-and-roth-iras).  


Once you have an empty Traditional IRA account and a Roth IRA account (can be empty or in use) do the following.  


1.  Contribute directly to your Traditional IRA by transferring money from your bank to your Traditional IRA up to the contribution limit.  Do not invest this money leave it in your settlement account.
2. As soon as the money shows up in the Traditional IRA open that account and select to carry out a conversion.  It is CRITICAL that you choose to do a conversion and NOT a recharacterization, those are two very different things.
3. Choose to convert the full traditional IRA balance to your Roth IRA.  Note if time has passed and the balance has increased in your traditional IRA it is perfectly fine to transfer the entire amount...contribution limits apply to contributions not conversions.  Just note you will be taxed on any growth that has occurred which is why it is better to convert as soon as you can.
4. Once the money shows up in your Roth it will again be in your settlement account, so take the time to use that money to invest.
5. If later on additional money shows up in your traditional for example a small dividend for the few days you had money in the settlement account it is not an issue to then convert that over to your Roth as well.  You should fully empty your account
6. Come tax time you will need to declare the traditional IRA contribution but make sure you choose to NOT deduct the amount contributed.  You also will need to fill out form 8606 for the conversion.

&#x200B;

**Fixing an inappropriate Roth contribution (for high income that mistakenly contributed direct to a Roth)**  
If you contribute directly to a Roth IRA then later you realize you are over the MAGI contribution limit then this section is for you. There are several ways to deal with this (such as just withdrawing the money directly) but I will go through the way I think makes the most sense and has the least consequences.  For this you will again need an open Roth IRA account and an open and empty Traditional IRA account.  


1. First you will need to perform a recharacterization of your Roth contribution for that tax year. The brokerage that has your Roth IRA should be able to provide you with the needed form for recharacterization. Recharacterizations are different than conversions in that it changes the contribution itself from being a Roth contribution to being a traditional contribution.  Select recharacterization, say the full contribution amount, the Roth account, the source for the money (wherever it is now invested) and the destination traditional IRA account.  If during transition the money was invested and earned or lost over time the amount that is will be transferred.  So for example if you contributed $7000 but after a week of investment it is now $7125 then $7125 will be recharacterized.  If it is now $6900 then $6900 will be recharacterized.  Note it will still be treated as a $7000 contribution so you don't have to worry about the contribution limit if that happens.
2. Next follow the backdoor Roth steps 2 through 6 once the money shows in your Traditional IRA.  By the end you should have the money back in your Roth account but without any penalties.  Note pro-rata rule still applies here so make sure you do not have invested Traditional IRA funds
3. At tax time in addition to the added 8606 form there will also be forms 1099-R and 5498 to cover the recharacterization.

&#x200B;

**Final Notes**  
For backdoor Roth and the recharacterization to backdoor Roth I mentioned pro rata.  I didn't want to go into the details on that but I will say here that ideally you don't have any traditional IRA funds to conduct those however if you do then there are potentially ways to clear that money out (like a rollover to a 401k) that you can look into.  Or you may decide the amount that you have in the traditional IRA is small enough that you are willing to just convert all of it and pay the taxes for doing so to clear it out.  Pro rata only becomes a true block of backdoor Roth if you have a significant amount invested pretax in a Traditional IRA and you have no way to roll it over into a 401k.  The majority of people should be able to contribute to a Roth IRA following the appropriate method for their income.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,TurboTax initially mishandled foreign tax credit for me this year. I would not recommend its use and had a much better experience with lower cost software,"I have a simple enough tax situation, and tried TurboTax due to a colleague's endorsement of its ability to reconcile cost basis info. I was deeply unimpressed, and also saw it catastrophically mishandle the foreign tax credit.

My tax situation

* W2
* dividends including significant foreign income
* a requirement to file form 1116
* minor interest income
* RSUs I sell immediately
* backdoor/mega roth conversions
* minor tax loss harvesting between near equivalent ETFs

TurboTax - for the form fetching and filling had minor pros

* handled the tax loss harvesting 1099-B's perfectly (auto-imported; I had to manually enter these for FreeTaxUSA)
* did not handle importing the correct cost basis for RSUs, though reconciling was more interactive than with FreeTaxUSA
* messed up some of the 1099-div imports (checked FACTA box when it wasn't checked), but easily fixed / saved time vs FreeTaxUSA. Though the fact that its importing functionality isn't 100% makes it much less useful.

What really surprised me was it proceeded to go ***way*** off the rails from 1099-div income

* it brought up some internal interface in a microscopic region that wouldn't proceed until I checked a box to credit foreign tax paid without reconciliation via 1116
* after that, it correctly did not directly credit ***all*** foreign tax paid which is not permissible for my situation, but it did not credit ***any*** foreign tax paid, which is wrong in the other direction. At the ""review"" step it didn't flag that it was leaving thousands of dollars in credit unclaimed
* going back to the deductions section, and going through the interview for foreign tax credit the 1st time, it asked if I worked in a foreign country and after saying no told me I don't qualify for any credit, which was clearly wrong. I had already reported foreign income and tax!
* going through the interview again it noted I already reported foreign income and tax and worked the 2nd time

I was honestly surprised at how bad the TurboTax experience was. If I didn't already know what my tax situation was its interview format would have arrived at a clearly incorrect tax bill that was too high.

It's not worth 10$, and certainly not worth the outrageous ***178$*** they wanted. Free software (I do pay 15$ for my NY/NYC taxes) worked ***drastically*** better for me.

I do still have a philosophical opposition to having to pay money to a 3rd party software firm to pay my taxes, but not to the point I'm filling out a paper return for NY.

Back in 2015, I got into crypto for fun (or say accidently) and made some money, but totally regret not taking it more seriously. Now, I'm focusing on freelancing. Just landed my first official project and got paid in advance. After platform/withdrawal/conversion fees and taxes etc., I have around ₹4k leftover (also deducting the possible expenses around ₹1k). It's not much, but it's a start!

* 25 year old freelancer (just starting out, not a pro yet)
* No fixed income (freelancing is unpredictable!)
* Currently living with relatives (no rent, but expenses are around ₹1k/month)
* Have some savings from previous work (around ₹10k)
* Have around 40k+ in crypto but Indian government is making it harder and harder to cash it out and I also have no plans to withdraw all of the amount aswell, since I know most of that will be go towards paying taxes.

1. Should I invest some of this money (say ₹4k) to learn about investment platforms and plans?
2. I was thinking about building an emergency fund and then putting some money into SIPs (maybe ₹500/month). How much should I aim for in my emergency fund?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Able to save but are my goals unreachable?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been very fortunate so far and put myself in a decent position.

I’m 33, married, no kids. My take home after taxes is about 10K a month. I’m putting into retirement (not a lot, really the minimum) and I have a liquid 4 month emergency fund. No CC debt. No loans. If I need to I can push to save $2500 a month but I’m consistently saving 2K per month. 

We don’t take vacations, don’t overspend and adhere to our budget very strictly (edit: perhaps not strictly enough). That extra $500 generally we save and earmark for big purchases for QOL items (new air conditioner, etc.). I also have an extra cushion and built in contingencies where if I need to I can liquidate absolutely everything and have about 50k close to near immediately. Comfortably with no big changes I have about 20K liquid on hand. 

I live in an extremely high cost of living area (top 3). The issue is I want to buy a house at some point because I’m sick of renting and pissing money away and was originally saving for that but the average house in my city costs around 1 million. The lowest house in an area where it’s still safe is 750k - 850k. We could move to a nearby area that’s farther but the houses there are still 600k-650k and I would have to use my car to commute and pay tolls every day.

I guess my bottom line question is, what is the move? Do I just keep slowly saving for a down payment? Should I abandon that idea and pump everything into retirement accounts? COOPs in my area are about 400-600k and I can do the mortgage on those pretty easy but the HOA fees are going to crush my saving potential down to about $600 a month. The other thing is that it doesn’t solve the down payment question. 

It sucks because at this point it looks like I’m literally stuck until I get an inheritance which seems really fucked up and morbid and won’t happen for a long time (hopefully, we both have extremely good relationships with our parents).  But I really don’t know where to go from here. 

The other thing is that my job is very region specific. If I pick up and go to a lower cost of living area my income is going to drop significantly with the same type of job. My wife’s also but to a lesser extent. My estimate for moving to a lower COL are would put our monthly take home at around 6k - 7k a month. 

Any advice so I’m not just “saving to save?”

Edit: After a review and some math, my fixed expenses come out to about 6300 a month which leaves us about 3800 a month. From there I take the 2k for savings, then household expenses, etc and the rest I let stay and build in the checking account which currently has a little more of a months worth of an additional emergency fund.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Should my Mom (55) buy this Annuity (Athene AscentSM Pro 10) to supplment her retriement income after 62?,"My Mom is 55 (pretty health and active) and is pitched by her friend to buy this Annuity (Athene AscentSM Pro 10) product to supplement her retirement income. Basically if she put down $100,000 today, she can withdraw $11,020 annually (guaranteed) until her death.  This product is so called single premium fixed indexed deferred annuity.

Here are some benefits:

Annual Rider Charge Rate: 1.00%

Income Base Bonus: $20,000

Income Base Crediting option: Option 1 - Guaranteed Growth1

Income Option for Lifetime Income Withdrawals: Level

Lifetime Income Withdrawal type: Single

Annuitant's age at first Lifetime Income Withdrawal: 62

Guaranteed Lifetime Income Withdrawal amount: $11,020 (Annual)

So I did a caculation that assume she put $100,000 into S&P 500 index with an assumption that average annual return of 8%, it will take her approximately 16 years to withdraw $11,000 annually from an initial $100,000 investment in the S&P 500 index. So I guess this Annuity is Okay as long as she can live longer than 81 or 82?

I’ve made a $2k post tax contribution into the new traditional IRA and immediately converted it into my existing Roth when it settled as cash as part of my 2023 contribution.

Next year when I get to full 100% salary, I am considering changing my allocations to at least 50% Roth if not, 100%. I am just torn between whether or not I should keep the money in Fixed as opposed to Variable.  I am also unsure of what exactly the last line of the Variable means. ""The Variable Program also includes a 4% annual incremental increase credited monthly to your accumulated units.""  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

""-The Fixed Program offers you a guaranteed annual rate of return on your investment, set by the New York State legislature. The return on the Fixed Program is currently 7% per year for UFT members and 8.25% per year for all other members.

-The Variable Program invests in a fully diversified portfolio of common stock. The financial objective is to capture the return of the broad equity market, while attempting to control its short-term volatility. The value of your Variable Program holdings is based on the investment performance of the portfolio and may increase or decrease from month to month. Since this program is subject to the fuctuations of the stock market, it may carry higher risk than the Fixed Program, but offers the potential for greater return. The Variable Program is currently co-invested in the Teacher’s Retirement System Tax Deferred Annuity Variable A Program, and returns are based on the performance of the investments in that program. The Variable Program also includes a 4% annual incremental increase credited monthly to your accumulated units.""",2024-04-28 21:47:17,1.0,1.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Fixing a backdoor Roth IRA mistake,"I'm thinking about retirement and I opened a traditional IRA for the first time this year and contributed to it the max of 2023 ($6,500) and 2024 ($7000) limits.

In hindsight, I did not think very clearly at all. I make just over the income limit for my contributions to be tax-deductible. I have been looking into performing a backdoor Roth IRA, but not sure of the exact steps and tax forms to fill out.

What is the easiest way to do a backdoor Roth IRA in my current position? I am aware of the pro-rata rule and don't mind paying the taxes on that when it comes to it. I would just like to deal with as few forms/steps as possible so I don't mess anything else up.

Alternatively, is it possible to just call my financial institution to remove all contributions from the traditional IRA and make it seem like I never opened it in the first place?",2024-03-07 16:38:24,2.0,5.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Backdoor prorata rule - Fixed Indexed Annuities,"Need Help with Pro Rata Rule!  
Hey everyone, I could use some advice on the pro-rata rule when it comes to a Backdoor Roth IRA.  
Here's the scoop: I've been diving into the world of Backdoor Roth IRAs since I'm not eligible for a Roth IRA due to my high income. I recently opened both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA in my brokerage account. This morning, I funded my traditional IRA with $7000.  
Now, here's where it gets a bit tricky. I don't have any other IRAs, but I did roll over around $150k from my previous company's 401k into Fixed Indexed Annuities (FIA). None of that 401k amount was converted to Roth, so is it considered a traditional IRA?  
My burning question is, if I decide to convert this $7000 to a Roth IRA, will it be subject to the pro-rata rule due to the rollover from my 401k? What steps should I take in this situation?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,2023 Roth IRA contributions over limit; trying to backdoor Roth. Help?,"For the 2023 tax year, my wife and I maxed out our Roth IRAs ($6500 ea). After receiving my W-2, I realized our MAGI >$228k and that we cannot contribute to Roth IRAs directly. I performed a recharacterization on both accounts to fix this issue. I understand I should receive some 1099-Rs for this action. I also recharacterized the 2024 contributions we have already made.

&#x200B;

Now, according to the flowchart, I should do a ""backdoor Roth"" and convert the money to Roth IRA for 2023.

For my wife's IRA account, I think this is simple: The IRA was empty before the recharacterization. I can convert the entire after-tax IRA (\~$7000) and pay taxes on the gains (\~$500) that are now characterized as having happened in the IRA.

My IRA has a previously employer's 401(k) rollover in it (\~$50k) + the recharacterization (\~$7000). I can reverse rollover the \~$50k pre-tax portion into my current employer's 401(k). Then convert the remaining after-tax IRA (\~$7000) and pay taxes on the gains (\~$500) that are now characterized as having happened in the IRA.

&#x200B;

On the 2024 backdoor Roth, I need to convert the current IRA contributions (and will have to pay taxes on the gains) and set new contributions to be to a money market fund instead of mutual funds. The mutual funds should be bought after converting to Roth IRA.

&#x200B;

Is my understanding of this process correct? Does this avoid the pro-rata rule and allow me to backdoor Roth my 2023 contributions while only paying taxes on the gains that originally happened in the Roth IRA? Is my process for backdoor Roth contributions in 2024 correct? Thanks!

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Confused about pro rata rule for faulty 2023 contributions to Roth IRA,"I have a weird situation. I originally anticipated a much lower income for 2023, but with an unexpected bonus and a lot more income from 1099s, me and my wife became ineligible to contribute to Roth IRA for 2023. The problem is, my wife has been contributing a set amount every month to her Roth IRA (I have not yet and am wanting to before April 15th 2024). She hasn't met the IRA limit for the year. The issue is, I just realized this while doing my taxes just now, and have a significant balance in my Rollover IRA that I have not yet rolled over into my current 401k. 

My understanding is that I can still correct course for a Backdoor Roth IRA for 2023 contributions by doing the following, but not fully sure if I'm correct.

1. Rollover my existing Rollover (Trad) IRA into my 401k ASAP

2. Once that is done, recharacterize my wife's Roth IRA -> Trad IRA (She still wants to hit the $6500 limit so I imagine she can contribute the rest in the Trad IRA once the account is open). At the roughly same time, I make 2023 contributions before April 2024 to a Trad IRA

3. Do T -> Roth conversions for both of us. And repeat for the 2024 contributions. 

4. For 2023 taxes by April 15, 2024, I don't have to worry about filing Form [5439](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf) and just have to file Form 8606 on both 2023 taxes, and 2024 taxes for contributions, and conversions.

The pro rata rule on when the balance for Trad IRA needs to be 0 is a bit confusing to me, but reading [https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/fix-backdoor-roth-ira-screw-ups/](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/fix-backdoor-roth-ira-screw-ups/) it seems like they just need to be 0 on the year the conversion is done (before December 31, 2024), even if I am converting the 2023 contributions in 2024.

Is this correct? Or am I missing something here?",2024-02-29 20:49:42,0.0,5.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Tricky situation: gift of house,"Hello,

Longtime lurker, first time poster. My husband (35M) and I (35F) are currently undergoing IVF to have our first child. We anticipate 1-2 children.

One thing we stress about, as I’m sure most unlucky millennials do, is the current housing crisis and our inability to produce generational wealth because we don’t own property. We are currently renting a 3-bedroom home for $3,500. We live in a VHCOL area. We want to own a home, but we don't want to be house poor.

I make $150k/yr and my husband is finishing his master’s degree and just working part-time right now. Once he graduates next year, I expect he will make $150k/yr as well. We do not have any debt. We have $250k saved up for a down payment.

I have two sisters (42F) and (45F). My widowed mother (70F) told me that she helped purchase a home for my oldest sister and her husband a few years ago. The home has been in my mom’s name, but she just sold the home to them and it increased $250k in value. My mom said she “gifted” that equity to my sister when she sold her the house in 2022 and she did not pay taxes. (This goes against everything I’ve read online about taxes on gifts of equity, so I wonder if she did pay taxes but didn’t realize it.) In any case, she said she would be willing to do the same deal for me, except with her current house.

Her 2,000 sqft home is worth $1.2M. She wants to downsize since she lives alone. She has offered to gift me $250k equity if I purchase her home. BUT she also wants to gift $250k cash to my other sister to be fair to all siblings. Again, I don’t think my mom understands the tax implications, which there are. Also, my mom owes $300k on her house. If she does what she is proposing, then after the reduced price sale to me and the cash gift to the middle sibling, she walks away with merely $400k. That is not enough money for her to downsize. The average condo in our area costs between $700k-$800k. She is a on a fixed income, bringing home $5,600/month, and while this is an generous offer, I don’t want her to be saddled with today’s royally effed up interest rates on a mortgage. I want her to be financially stable.

She said, “Well, what are the options then?” so I’m turning to you, Reddit.

Here’s what I think the options are:

1 – Mom gifts equity of $250k to me and does not gift $250k cash to my middle sister. My mom should be able to buy a condo without a mortgage with the money leftover ($650k). In this scenario, a corresponding reduction in mine and my oldest sister’s payout from her estate upon her death will need to occur. Pro: I reap rewards of appreciation. Con: Middle sibling gets much later payout than us.

2 - I buy a condo and my mom and I switch houses. Pro: I get enough space for me, my husband and children to comfortably live. Low monthly payments. Con: Appreciation on tiny condo will be nowhere near a home.

3 - I buy my mom’s home for $1.2M. I take a mortgage for $1M, and she takes a second mortgage on the home for the remaining $200k. A corresponding reduction will be made to her estate. Pros: Low monthly payments. Cons: mom gets a mortgage at these stupid interest rates.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Roth Conversion Help,"Hi, I have about 30K in a traditional IRA. My yearly base salary is 159k which puts me above the Roth IRA income limit to contribute and also above the traditional IRA income limit to be able to take a yearly deduction on my taxes (accounting for MAGI adjustments). If I contribute to a traditional and max that every year I need to fill out IRS form 8606 and also record keep that every year I can't deduct, which seems like a huge pain...I'm 28, have some time ahead of me, and that's a lot of paper work to beat the double tax hit in retirement. I also know if I convert it all at once it will send me into a higher tax bracket too.

I'm currently locked out of being able to contribute to my Roth via backdoor so should I just convert all of my Traditional to Roth and eat the taxes up front? I could try to roll it into my employer sponsored 401k Plan but last time I checked they need some sort of ""proof"" that all the funds are pre-tax and my brokerage isn't able to ""determine"" that information. What makes things worse is last year 2023 I added after tax funds to my traditional before knowing I couldn't take the deduction so converting small amounts a year will run into pro-rata (this is how I found out about form 8606). I also realize I could put the same amount into a standard brokerage account but I'll be missing out on great tax opportunities and estate vehicles.

 I'd appreciate any advice on the topic

Any decent place in my state is around 1400 for rent and my 2013 CRV has a transmission that's starting to fail (has been since 2020). I would like to try to get it fixed, but everyone I spoke to said that since its around 160k miles, might as well use the money as a downpayment for a new (used) car. 

 I like the longevity of Honda, Toyota, Mazda, etc. and am trying to buy a used CRV, Rav4, or CX-5. The price range is around 20k for a 2020 model, and I plan on getting that closer to the end of the year when I have more saved up to use as a downpayment.

In progression of 2024:  
1. Pay off 16k student loans (1500 a month so I can have it gone EOY)  
2. Save up 10k as emergency funds (700 a month so I can make money from my HYSA)  
3. Save up 5-7k for downpayment of car (300-500 a month) 

If my car breaks down earlier than expected, whatever saved in my emergency fund would be used for downpayment, then I would focus on building that up.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Trying to figure out how big an idiot I've been (retirement),"We're married (48m, 46f) and we are just starting to try to get a handle on our retirement situation. I know - late to the party. I've been reading as much as I can to try to figure out what we need to do. We've been contributing to 403b accounts for years, but not really managing it or paying attention to them. Now, as I'm contemplating our taxes for 2023, I'm starting to think I may have royally screwed up and I'm not sure there is a way to fix it. Here's the situation:

I had 2 different 403(b) accounts ($100k total) from former employers still with the original investment company. After doing some reading, I discovered that the investment choices were terrible, so I rolled them over into a traditional IRA thinking that having lower-cost investment options would be the right way to go. Did the rollovers earlier this year.

My 403(b) account through my current employer has employer contributions as pre-tax, but my contributions as Roth. I chose that when I started a few years ago because I had heard that it was a good idea to have a mix of traditional and Roth. We make too much money ($150k/year combined) to be able to deduct contributions to a traditional IRA, but I realize now that we're missing out on the pre-tax contributions that I could have been making to my 403(b) because I chose to make them as Roth. Now, facing the prospect of a hefty tax bill for 2023, I'm realizing that I may be giving a few extra thousand dollars in taxes because of my own stupidity and not having paid attention to these issues before now.

Is there anything that can be done? From the looking I've done, it appears that 401k contributions can only be made through payroll. So, making some kind of deductible lump sum contribution is not an option. As I said, we can't do a traditional IRA contribution either - at least not one that would be deductible and help lessen our tax bill. Am I just screwed and have to pay the ""stupid"" tax?

Also - on a somewhat related not - I \*think\* I can open and fund a Roth IRA without having to worry about the pro rata rule because we don't make enough to have to worry about doing the backdoor Roth thing. Is that right?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"Pro-rata triggered by Backdoor Roth IRA. Yikes, help!","Hi all - looking for advice! Here’s what I did this year, and I realized I unintentionally triggered the pro-rata rule.

1. Had a previous employer 401k rolled over to a traditional IRA. $55k. I wanted more options and they were charging me monthly fees.
2. As I done in the past, I did a backdoor Roth IRA conversion (6.5k after tax dollars put into a separate traditional IRA, then transferred balance to my existing Roth IRA).
3. Because I did all the above in 2023, I believe I triggered pro-rata rule.

Any advice to fix my mistake or mitigate damage? Otherwise, my understanding is that my 6.5k conversion will be subject to high taxes (ouch!!) and I will need to do paperwork every year for the $55k traditional ira since it has a blended mix of tax/pre-tax money due to that pesky pro-rata rule.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Roth 401(k) Accidentally Rolled into Traditional Rollover IRA,"     Apologies for the length, just really stuck and wanted to include the relevant info. Back in February of 2023, I rolled over $20,000 from a previous company's Roth 401(k) into a Traditional Rollover IRA with Fidelity. This should not have been possible - transferring between different types of tax advantaged accounts like this is illegal. However, at the time, I was not aware that the rollover IRA was traditional (silly, I know), there were no controls to prevent it, and I only just realized when I started doing my taxes this year. In the time the money has been in the account, it has accrued an additional ~$1000 of earnings.

     After contacting Fidelity several times, each person gave me different instructions. They were, in order:
     1.   Complete an IRA recharacterization form. However, that does not apply to a rollover contribution like this, so it wouldn't process. So I called Fidelity again.
     2.   Perform a roth conversion, but that is not possible because the initial rollover was illegal since it went from Roth to traditional. So they transferred me to a new rep
     3.   The new rep told me to contact a tax accountant and do as they instruct. After calling a tax accountant I was informed that this should be able to be fixed by Fidelity since my 2023 taxes have not yet been submitted. So I called Fidelity again
     4.   This time, Fidelity said that due to the rollover happening ~1 year ago, the only thing that could be done is to complete a Return of Excess, have the funds sent back to me, then complete a Certification for Late Rollover Contribution. This would create a taxable event that would need to be reported on my 2024 taxes

     After reviewing the return of excess form, it didn't really seem to be appropriate for my situation since it's not really an excess contribution.  Additionally, I don't know what the actual financial implications of this being a taxable event are, so I don't know what to expect. I know its my fault for making this mistake, but I have no idea what the right way to fix it is and could use some help.",2024-02-26 22:28:20,0.0,3.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Another Annoying IRA Question. How dumb am I?,"TL/DR: My wife and I each have traditional IRAs that we don’t qualify for a tax deduction. What should we do with these accounts?

Longer version:
So I have yet another annoying IRA question. My wife and I are in our mid forties, and started saving for retirement late. I started maxing my employers Simple IRA a few years ago and realized in 2022 that I needed to up our savings big time. We now save 26% gross including employer match. I maxed my employers plan, and maxed what was initially a Roth IRA for each of us, then the remaining went to a taxable brokerage account. Up until that point our income had been below the Roth limits. However, by end of the year to my income put us over the limit. We re-characterized the Roth IRA to a traditional IRA, believing that while we didn’t qualify for a tax deduction, it was still better than a brokerage account. We’ve since maxed out the traditional IRAs in 2023 and invested the money. 

I’ve read recently that we may be mistaken. That if we don’t qualify for a tax deduction for a standard IRA and our income is above the limits for a Roth, we were better off investing in a traditional brokerage account as the taxes will be at a long term gains rate compared to the traditional IRAs, which in this case would actually be taxed as normal income. Is that right? Looking for clarification on this as it seems we misunderstood before, and thought there was still a benefit to holding the IRAs. 

I realize the standard advice given in our situation is that we should do a backdoor Roth IRA. However, my employer Simple IRA has prevented me from doing that in the past. My employer has grown and switched to a 401K beginning this year, so perhaps this is a possibility now, but I’m honestly not sure what to do with the traditional IRAs in this case. I believe I could roll over the Simple IRA and my tiny Rollover IRA into my 401K. 

Our accounts for reference:

My accounts:
401K: $0 (just started 2024)
Simple IRA: $167K
Trad IRA: $14K
Rollover IRA: $2K
Taxable brokerage: $56K

Wife’s accounts:
Trad IRA: $13K
Taxable brokerage: $45K

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"(CAN) Ontario. Bipolar/ADHD, horrible at life and taxes. I'm a decade behind. How do I just pay someone to do it for me?","Yes, I already posted this to the Personal Finance Canada subreddit, but I'm submitting it here too for visibility. Please just ignore if you can't answer about Canadian taxes.

----

I haven't done my taxes in something like 8-10 years. ***Please be kind.*** I know I should have kept on top of this stuff, but I'm not mentally well (more on this at the end).

Facts here:

---

I'm low income, so I don't expect to owe the government. In fact, I've probably lost out on some tax credits or rebates (like the grocery rebate).

I just want to get it done. 

I don't know how to get started. I tried logging into My Service Canada and that was a PROCESS because my ID had an error on it which caused the system to think that I was not the person my SIN number corresponded to. Once I got my ID fixed, I was able to log in, but it had NO information about my T4s and it just keeps giving me an error message. 

I contacted the CRA about it, but they said they couldn't move forward with me. The lady on the phone said that I'd have to send a letter to some PO box for the CRA (wrote it down somewhere but I forget the exact details), explaining the situation and asking them to provide me information about which years I still have to file and ask for T4s to be mailed to me. I thought this might be a little unusual, but I checked my credit report through my bank just in case, and there's nothing unusual ... I think it's some kind of glitch or perhaps caused because it's just been THAT LONG since I did my taxes last. In fact, I've actually never done any kind of taxes for myself. My mom did them for me until she died when I was 20 or so.

This is honestly kind of overwhelming. I just want to pay someone to get it done for me, to catch me up, so it's not something weighing on my mind, you know? Hopefully I'll be entitled to some tax refunds which will help to offset the costs of paying someone to get this done. 

My taxes will probably involve the following:

- T4s from over 10 employers (I've job hopped a lot) *(can't find the T4s)*

- I've applied for and received payments from OSAP a few times, and I've had tuition related expenses *(can't find documentation)*

- I've had to pay for some certifications for work several times *(I have these receipts)*

- I've had some out of pocket medical expenses that I may be eligible to submit *(I have these receipts)*

- Is it true that there's some kind of rent tax benefit or something? Someone mentioned that to me once - I'm definitely a renter and low income... do I submit receipts for that for some minor tax break or something? *(I have these receipts going back 10 years, never claimed them). 

- I qualified for EI this year starting from July and it ends in February. I've had a part time job while I collected reduced payments. *(I don't have the documentation of this yet, but I'm sure I'll be mailed something)*

- During covid I accumulated some credit card debt because I was unemployed for almost 2 years. Didn't qualify for CERB since I was a student. I've heard you can claim for credit card debt? *(I have some bills to verify, I'm sure the call to my CC company is straightforward)*

- I did collect the student version of CERB in the summer of 2020, but I was only eligible for half payments for something like 3 or 4 months. *(can't find documentation)*

- I have 72 cents in a TFSA. I might have moved around up to $3,000 - $6,000 around several years ago which I used to pay for school either within that year or the year after. *(I think I can get this info from my bank)*

These are the most complicated claims that might reduce my taxable income (if they're valid). 

I don't operate a business, I'm not self-employed. I haven't been married, I have no kids or dependents, I'm not a senior and I don't have a disability (yet). 

I am also interested in applying for the Disability Tax Credit, but only after I've caught up on my taxes. My psychologist recommended it after reviewing my employment history. I am undergoing an extensive psychological assessment for severe bipolar disorder and severe ADHD, both of which have been undiagnosed until recently (I'm 32). The testing is going to take place over the course of several months, and I'd love to have completed all my taxes by then, so that the psychologist can fill out the documentation for a mental disability. BTW, the severe ADHD and bipolar are why I've been so disorganized, unable to complete my education, and had frequent job losses. 

**So here are my questions:**

- What kind of tax professional should I be looking for? 

- How do I verify that they're charging me a fair price and they're not some kind of scam artist? I don't want to hand out my tax info to just any random person who says they do bookkeeping for example. 

- Do you have any specific suggestions for businesses that help with individual taxes like this? 

I'm in Toronto. I don't mind over-paying a *little bit* if I know they're legitimate, thorough, and actually convenient. This has been in the back of my mind making me feel guilty for years, and being on medication for the first time in my life is giving me some stability and follow through. I recently qualified for EI for the first time after a job loss in my entire life, it's allowed me to save a little bit of money. Getting properly medicated was my first priority, and now it's figuring out my taxes. Someone in a similar position to me (like almost identical income and stuff) ended up getting $35,000 back in taxes because she was so low income and hadn't claimed in so long. Even if I get half of that, that could be life changing because I could finish school (I'm ONE CREDIT AWAY).

Anyway, any tips on this would be appreciated.",2023-12-18 19:12:33,0.0,7.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Pros/cons of backdoor Roth IRA if you have substantial pre-tax money in traditional IRA?,"Let's say I have $400k of pre-tax contributions in my traditional IRA. Next year I want to do a backdoor Roth because I anticipate I'll be over the income limit. 

It seems my options are either:

* Contributing $7k after-tax money to my existing traditional IRA with $400k, however this seems like a mess to handle from a tax perspective (pro-rata rule and all)
* Rolling over ALL money from my traditional IRA to my employer 401k, then contributing $7k to the IRA (so it will contain only after-tax dollars)

Curious what other folks have done in this situation.",2023-12-16 16:47:51,1.0,7.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"I have mixed asset in my traditional IRA due to pro rata rule, how to move forward this year?","Hi everyone, for simplicity's sake, let's say that I have $65,000 in my traditional IRA account last year, 6,500 of which is post-tax money I put in to do a Roth conversion.  
  
Therefore, my Roth conversion is taxed at 90% ratio aka 5,850 dollars will be added to my tax bill.  
I then will have 58,500 remaining in my traditional IRA account this year as a mixed asset of 90% pre-tax and 10% post tax money. If I want to be done with this mess and eat the tax bill, I will convert all the amount and pay 90% of the remaining 58,500 dollars when I convert to Roth this year.  
  
My question is, how much asset value am I paying off based on the 90%? **Is it during the conversion event?** Say if I don't want to convert now and my 58,500 turns to 70,000 due to asset appreciation in July of 2024, then I decide to do the conversion that month - **do I just end up paying 90% pretax money of 70,000 at the time?** And then I can do Roth conversion cleanly when the account value in traditional IRA is at 0 in July 2024 without further changing the percentage/ratio?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Need Advice on Roth IRA Missteps and Transferring Funds,"Hi guys,

I'm dealing with a complex situation and would appreciate your advice. As first-generation immigrants, my family and I lack financial literacy. I learned about Roth IRAs in early college and found the information transformative. Since 2019, I've been contributing to my Roth IRA with various income sources. However, I've recently realized that eligibility for Roth IRA contributions requires a W2 showing equivalent earned income, which I don't have.  
  
Furthermore, I advised my parents to open Roth IRAs. They were eligible for their contributions, but I made a mistake managing their accounts. Lured by Robinhood's Roth IRA match, I opened accounts with them in 2022 but didn't transfer previous contributions from Fidelity. I mistakenly withdrew funds from their Fidelity accounts, thinking I could transfer them to Robinhood. This resulted in ""EARLY DIST NO EXCEPT EARLY DST/NO EXCP"" for my mother and me, and ""NORMAL DISTR PARTIAL"" for my father.  
  
Here's a breakdown of the contributions and withdrawals:  
  
\- My contributions (ineligible for all years):   
  \- Fidelity: 2019-2021: $6,000 each year; 2022: -$6,000 (early distribution)  
  \- Robinhood: 2022: $6,000 (+$60 match); 2023: $6,500 (+$65 match)  
  
\- My mother's contributions (Age 50+):   
  \- Fidelity: 2022: -$7,000 (early distribution)  
  \- Robinhood: 2022: $7,000 (over-contribution)  
  
\- My father's contributions (Age 50+):   
  \- Fidelity: 2022: -$7,000 (normal distribution, partial)  
  \- Robinhood: 2022: $7,000 (over-contribution)  
  
For my situation, it seems I need to treat these as over-contributions and withdraw them as I dont see any other option.  
  
I'm also aware of the community's view on Robinhood. However, considering transfer fees ($75) and Fidelity's variable coverage for transfers under $25,000, I'm contemplating transferring everything from Fidelity to Robinhood to benefit from their 1% rollover match and 3% contribution match for Gold members. This might be offset by the $1,000 margin offered at 0%. I might reverse the transfer after five years when it seems more viable to either Vanguard or Fidelity. What do should I do? Should I consult with a tax professional?   
  
I'm currently looking through this helpful article by Travis Sickle,  
https://www.theincrediblepenny.com/how-to-fix-excess-roth-ira-contributions/

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Married Filing Separately,"Everyone always say filing jointly basically always come out ahead, but I was wondering if I'm in one of those situations where it would just be easier to file separately:

I'm military stationed in MD, my legal home of record is NY. Since I don't maintain a home in NY but do in MD, I file taxes as a NY non-resident, and pay 0 state tax for my military income. My wife is a MD resident. It seems like per the administrative release #1 ([https://www.marylandtaxes.gov/forms/Tax\_Publications/Administrative\_Releases/Income\_and\_Estate\_Tax\_Releases/ar\_it1.pdf](https://www.marylandtaxes.gov/forms/Tax_Publications/Administrative_Releases/Income_and_Estate_Tax_Releases/ar_it1.pdf)):

""Military servicemembers who are domiciled(legal residents) in a state other than Maryland. -> Married having a resident civilian spousewith income. -> If a joint Maryland resident return is filed(for this filing, Form 502 may not be submittedelectronically), a pro forma joint Marylandnonresident return (Forms 505 and 505NR) mustalso be completed and submitted as an attachmentto the joint resident return.""

So basically, filing jointly means I would have to file my non-resident NY return, plus a joint MD return (form 502), PLUS a joint MD non-resident return, the latter two of which can't be done electronically for this situation. It seems like a giant pain that can be fixed by just filing separately. Our gross incomes are similar anyway and we don't have kids.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,"""fixing"" a non-deductible IRA contribution","During the last week of 2023, I estimated that I would owe a bit in taxes due to a large one-time PTO pay out. I was aware of the $6,500 contribution limit as a single person to an IRA, but I wasn't aware that since I make over $83,000 and have a 401k at work that my $4,000 contribution to this new account wouldn't be deductible.

My income for 2023 is too much to contribute to a Roth IRA, so I was thinking that since this contribution is already taxed and not deductible that I would do a backdoor Roth and convert the $4,000 (slightly more now due to the market going up) to a Roth IRA. However, I have a six figure IRA from rolling over my old emplyer's 401k, which means I'd have to deal with complications of the *pro rata rule* ([1](https://smartasset.com/retirement/a-guide-to-the-pro-rata-rule-and-roth-iras), [2](https://rgwealth.com/insights/how-to-avoid-the-pro-rata-rule-with-backdoor-and-mega-roth-conversions/), etc.).

Before I make things even harder for myself by not having all of the information, I'm asking what my options are and what their consequences are. As best as I can tell my options are:

1. Leave the money in the IRA, which I've already paid income taxes on, until retirement and then enjoy paying taxes again when I withdraw in 20+ years.
1. Move my rollover IRA to my current employer's 401k, leaving me with just my ~$4,000 IRA that I can backdoor Roth without complication, knowing that my funds are stuck in the 401k until I change jobs.
1. Convert just the ~$4,000 IRA to a Roth and deal with the pro rata rule and owe taxes on the bulk of it ... and further complicating all future transactions.
1. Convert all of my IRA funds to a Roth IRA and pay a ton of taxes now.
1. Something else I'm missing.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Financial options if we sell rented flat - UK,"Without heading into too much of a rant, I will try to sum it up my rational-but feel free to skip to the next paragraph to my question. I am fed up with renting my flat in London. Worried about anti-landlord laws that seem to come up every year, not happy with the general hassle, unexpected costs, taxes, management fees, quirky tenants, potential risks, etc. People act like renting out a flat in London must be a gold mine and it’s not- we have had zero cash flow the last few years- all rent profit has gone into a repayment mortgage. We go out of pocket for ground rent, service charges to our freeholder, income taxes, aforementioned costs. The flat has gone up in value £15k per year and our tenants pay off our mortgage- great. We are at the end of our term and remortgaging to an interest only mortgage- what was repaying the flat before will now just be paying interest! Not so great until rates come down. The main redeeming factor of this flat is now the appreciation of it. Generally just growing tired of an investment that takes a decent amount of work and can’t get my mind off the potential risks- pro-tenant legislation in the pipeline, not receiving rent, etc. The interest rate situation has me rethinking it. I have reviewed moving the flat into a corporation and that doesn’t make financial sense either. 

Question is- if we sell the flat and reinvest the money- is there an equivalent investment that could be made? Something that would grow in value around £15k per year but be subject to less “work”, less taxes. We would have £150k that we could reinvest- maybe £130k of which we wouldn’t need to access for years. What types of accounts are out there? Any secret options? Good nest eggs for our kids? We are not financial wizards by any means so interested what some of those who are would suggest. 

General comments we get are always “wow what a great nest egg”, “you’re so lucky to have a flat in London, hold onto that”. I’m starting to think there are better ways though and want to hear about it before getting an advisor involved. 

PS as I don’t want to receive hate- I understand laws need to protect tenants, I just think landlords need to be accounted for too since we are not all Ferrari driving slumlords and I have no problem paying required tax. We just happen to have a tiny flat we scraped together savings to buy, renovate and live in but when time came to have kids we chose to move and let it out.",2024-02-14 07:19:45,2.0,3.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

I'm planning to take the Rollover IRA and move it back into a 401k in order to achieve a Backdoor Roth going forward. This would happen in the tax year 2024.

1) Rollover the 2023 after-tax traditional IRA contribution into a Roth in tax year 2024, is this taxable?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Prior year HSA overcontribution; how to fix?,"In 2022 I joined a new employer in April and was covered under a HDHP. We had an open enrollment in October and I decided to switch to a PPO plan which became effective the same year November. I didn't realize HSA contributions needed to be pro-rated at the time, so I maxed out the HSA for that year.

I've since used up all those funds in 2023 and didn't have any earnings and investments. When I try to account for this in turbotax, confusingly it doesn't say that I'm subject to the last month rule and it doesn't try to add the additional $1825 in income. I can ""force it"" to add the amount by pretending my HDHP coverage was from July 2022-Dec 2022 instead of May 2022-Oct-2022, but not sure if that's the correct way of fixing this issue.

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Retirement and House Purchase Savings - Request for Strategy Assessment,"I am struggling with some financial planning issues at the start of this new calendar year as I assess my current strategies and plan for the next few years.  Most of the questions relate to retirement planning and how my retirement strategy interacts with my plan to purchase a home in the next few years in NYC.  I really appreciate any guidance or feedback that others can provide. 

**Age = 32**

**Gross Income = $310k + 75k bonus**

**Debt = $0** 

**Credit Score = 780**

**Savings = 485k** [[110k HYSA (5% APY), 375k CDs (~5%), 10k checking account]] 

**Retirement = $103k** 

Roth 401k = $67k (100% VFFVX Vanguard 2055 Target; all contributions to date have been Roth)
 
Traditional IRA = $27k (1/4 VOO, 1/4 VT, 1/4 VFIFX, and ~1/4 uninvested cash). 

HSA = $10k (1/3 split between VOO, FFLDX, FFEGX) 

**Context:**
I am in ""biglaw"" as an associate attorney. For those who do not know about biglaw, although pay is very high and increases each year, most associates are either let go or voluntarily leave within the first few years.  Long term prospects are far and few between.  I have been here for three years and have no plans to leave, but it is not uncommon to be shown the door after five years. Of the peers I started with just over 3 years ago, more than half have left my firm, with a large chunk of those leaving biglaw for positions with better work-life balance (and lower pay). This industry context is important because while I am hopeful I can stick it out at my firm for another four or five years, the prospects of making partner are close to zero and the chance of being cut loose during a market downturn is ever-present. Moreover, while leaving biglaw is typically by no means a death kneel to income, it is generally the case that leaving biglaw means taking a significant paycut (not unheard of for seniors to go from ~$500k total comp to ~$200k or less). That is all to say that my earning power, while strong at the moment, is fragile and subject to significant downward adjustment without much notice in the future. 

**On Savings:**
My rent is $3,500 monthly (plus utilities), and my lease runs until June 2025. Toward the end of my lease, I would like to buy a home. However, I live in NYC and I recognize that homeownership here may be untenable—the homes that fit my needs currently are in the $1.5mm to $2.5mm range.  

In light of a possible home purchase within the next 18 months, and the volatility of my possible future income, I have kept my savings in fixed-income products and a high-yield savings account. 

***Savings Question 1***: I am considering whether I should begin contributing $5k of new income per month into index funds, for longer-term investments. The substantial amount that I have already saved would remain in CDs/HYSA for the purposes of a down payment.  Is this strategy a mistake? Should I keep contributing those funds to conservative investments? 

**On Retirement:**
*At times I feel as though I'm behind the curve for my age (32) on retirement contributions (103k). 

***Retirement Question 1***: My employer allows for Mega Backdoor Roth 401k. I have not done this in the past because I have been prioritize a home purchase to dig my way out of paying rent each month.  Should I pursue a MBDR in order to ""catch up"" on retirement contributions?  Is it correct that I can withdraw funds from a MBDR without incurring a penalty (so that if I ""over"" contribute and need some of these funds for a home purchase in the next few years, I could)?

***Retirement Question 2***: All of my 401k contributions to date have been Roth. I know, at my tax rate that goes against the typical strategy. However, I prefer the certainty that if there is some major shift resulting in significantly higher tax rates when I retire, or if I continue working in some capacity when I begin taking distributions, the money in my 401k is the money that I will actually receive. Am I making a huge mistake? Should I start doing a blended approach of Roth and traditional contributions? Or should I make only traditional contributions?

****Retirement Question 3***: I have made my maximum traditional IRA contribution for 2024, but have not yet invested those funds. I am considering doing a Backdoor Roth IRA for those funds. However, given the pro rata rule, I'm not certain that this is even worth pursuing given the size of my existing traditional IRA.  Am I right that I will be taxed significantly if I try to convert those $7k to a Roth IRA? 

***Retirement Question 4***: Are my holdings in each of my retirement vehicles okay?  The one that stands out to me as needing to be replaced is FFEGX (in my HSA), but open to any and all suggestions.",2024-01-09 03:12:14,0.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Traditional IRA with both pre-tax and post-tax contributions - Convert post-tax to Roth IRA and roll over pre-tax to 401k?,"I want to confirm my logic for this fix. I've essentially done error #5 here: [https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/fix-backdoor-roth-ira-screw-ups/](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/fix-backdoor-roth-ira-screw-ups/)

* I have a Traditional IRA rolled over from 401k with my last employer with pre-tax dollars. It currently totals \~$70k.
* I've contributed non-deductible post-tax $17.5k to my Traditional IRA over the last 3 years (2022-2024), so 25% of my tIRA is post-tax and 75% is pre-tax (I'm above the income limit for tax deductibility of tIRA contribution, just didn't catch it until now).
* I also have a Roth IRA I've rolled over from a previous Roth 401k and have since contributed money to.

The solution from the WCI is:

>The fix for this is going to vary by the individual, but the easiest fix is to simply convert the entire IRA to a Roth IRA now, so you end up getting all your post-tax money into that Roth IRA. Another possible fix is to figure out a way to separate your basis in that IRA, roll the tax-deferred money into a 401(k), and then convert the basis left behind in the IRA.

However, I don't think paying taxes on converting $52.5k of pre-tax dollars sounds great, so I'm thinking of doing the latter:

* Convert the non-deductible post-tax $17.5k from my Traditional IRA to Roth IRA so that I get some tax benefit from it, but if I just do a conversion, I would get hit with the pro-rata rule (a backdoor Roth, but a bit delayed for contributions from previous years).
* Roll over the rest ($52,500) to my current 401k (I've already checked it allows reverse rollovers). 
* My Traditional IRA would be $0 so the pro-rata rule would no longer apply. My tax liability for the Roth conversion would be $0. 

Is this the best solution? In particular, my questions are:

1. Is my tax liability here for the conversion and rollover actually $0 since my Traditional IRA balance would be $0?
2. Does it matter in what order I do the Roth conversion and rollover to my 401k? Or am I okay as long as both are done by Dec 31st? 
3. Is this the correct way to split up post-tax and pre-tax dollars? The Roth conversion is just the total dollar value I've contributed to it post-tax and everything else in the account is considered pre-tax?

Reddit,Tax Fix Pro,Input or Reviews for Accounting / Bookkeeping / Business Finance software,"*Hi All!*

This is crossposted from r/selfhosted because I would prefer to go that route, however I'm also open to regular software that is paid, if it is on-prem and not extortionate on pricing.

I'm looking for new **Accounting / Bookkeeping / Business Finance software** and wanting some input from people with experience in the open-source and/or self-hosted options.  This thread is a bit long, but the goal is to be detailed and get good feedback.  I hope it helps me, and also serves as a helpful resource in the future for other people!

Let me start by saying I have searched and browsed this and other subreddits, and read the list at https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#money-budgeting--management

I don't mind going a bit overkill and installing an ERP system, if the accounting portion does what I need it to do.

I also don't mind paying a reasonable price for software that suits my needs, I'm just tired of being extorted by QuickBooks.  Truthfully, QuickBooks Desktop is fine in every regard except that they took away the ability to import bank statements and automatically match/reconcile transactions on the older versions.  So, now I'm looking for something new.  Also, cloud/remote access would definitely be useful for my business, but it really isn't a NEED.

I have browsed features and/or documentation, and/or demoed most things below.  Notes regarding my findings and observations will be added on most of the software.

**Personal Requirements of the Software:**

* Cash-basis accounting (but should also be able to do accrual, for other businesses)
* Item lists
   * Inventory items (where it tracks inventory, and costs, taxes, etc.)
   * Non-inventory items (no on-hand, cost, or taxation tracking - just keep a list and customer price)
   * Services
* Good invoicing capabilities, templates, etc.
* Sales tax **per invoice** (not per item), hopefully even per customer or customer location like QuickBooks.  Many accounting packages made outside the US seem to have taxes per item, which gets tedious, when I need to charge based on sale location (Manager.io has this issue)
* Import from bank statements on csv, qbo, qif, whatever, for income and expenses
* Easy matching / reconcile transactions by name on import, automatic for frequent vendors after programming name to name, etc.  Basically QuickBooks Bank Feeds, even if it works a little different.

**Things I don't need or care about:**

* AUTOMATIC import from/linking to bank accounts (I don't mind doing this manually and, for security and reliability, would almost prefer this.)
* Modern interface.  I want the product to be intuitive to use, but I really don't care what it looks like.

**Cloud Options I've found (Self-Host):**

* ERPNext / FrappeBooks
* Dolibarr
* EspoCRM
* LedgerSMB
* Flectra
* SQL-Ledger
* BigCapital
* FrontAccounting
* Firefly iii
* Apache OFBiz
* Tryton
* InvoiceNinja
* Idempiere / Adempiere / Compiere
* InvoicePlane

**Installable options I've found (Local):**

* [manager.io](http://manager.io)
* GnuCash

**The EASY answer is probably:**

* InvoiceNinja front end, [manager.io](http://manager.io) for the rest of the accounting

InvoiceNinja seems great.  Invoices look good, and it does sales tax the way I need it.  However, it doesn't do accounting.  [manager.io](http://manager.io) seems to work well enough for accounting, but the invoices are an issue because sales taxes are per-item.  That is far too tedious for me, because I need to charge sales tax based on sale location.

However, I would prefer to keep everything in one software if at all possible.

**Maybe a good fit:**

For all of these, I'm just not sure if the bank feeds and/or invoices are good enough.  It hasn't been that easy to figure out some of this in the available demos

* LedgerSMB
* SQL-Ledger
* FrontAccounting
* Flectra
* ERPNext / FrappeBooks
* Idempiere

**Not a good fit:**

* Akaunting
   * Pro: Basic accounting package seems to be good
   * Con: All additional ""apps"" are paid and fairly expensive once added up, even on self-hosted.  I need many of these such as Bank Feeds, Double Entry, Inventory, etc.
* Odoo
   * Most modules are paid; locked in at their mercy.
* Wave
   * Not self-hosted
   * Not double entry
   * Locked in at their mercy.
* BigCapital
   * Just doesn't seem mature enough yet
* GnuCash
   * All of these reasons:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/gnucash/comments/o4s1bx/im\_starting\_to\_see\_the\_serious\_limitations\_built/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnucash/comments/o4s1bx/im_starting_to_see_the_serious_limitations_built/)

**Haven't really been able to find much on:**

* Firefly iii
* Apache OFBiz
* Tryton

I am also cross-posting to a few other related subs for further reach:

Reddit,Steuer Web,1040.com review (and why I went back to FreeTaxUSA),"IDK if this will end up being helpful to anyone, it may save you an hour or two though. Just my experience with 2 [mostly] excellent tax filing sites for 2023 - 1040[.]com and FreeTaxUSA

The IRS site recommended 1040[.]com to me, and offered free State filing (the ever elusive turnkey Fed+State free+free solution that isn't a PDF from your state's website).

YMMV - for NY Taxes, at the end of the road it told me that NY forms weren't ready - I gather this means their forms, because I submitted everything otherwise needed - FreeTaxUSA said all was OK (and that went well last year). From what I can gather, they can't actually process NY Sate Taxes on this day. I will wait for a few weeks (mid Feb maybe) to see if they get it together, otherwise I will proceed with FreeTaxUSA's $16 total.

FreeTaxUSA, if you filed last year, took maybe 30min to complete - admittedly after having just run through the 1.5h 1040.com, re-familiarizing myself with the gotchas after a year of not thinking about tax things. FreeTaxUSA also has a W2 PDF Import feature, which was nice, but only saves maybe 10-15mins (I only found a single error, an errant extra item in box 14 of ""I"" with $0, which would make no material difference - meaning it was materially accurate, but not 100% perfect)

For 1040[.]com, I had a mathematical error, where it calculated my Fed Owed amount as damn near my AGI. I reached out to Live Chat Support, and within minutes the issue was solved - either their system mis-truncated my decimal, or I missed the decimal key (most likely), listing my income as being 100x higher than what it was (IDK why I still enter decimals, they're always rounded to nearst $). The Agent also gave me a couple of basic recommendations on a couple of other fields I filled out, which he noticed while looking over my forms to figure out what happened. Nothing major, but it was cool that he took the extra care.

I wanted to say that I was really happy with the quick response from Support from 1040[.]com, and overall it was pretty smooth given it was my 1st encounter with them (so extra entries) and the manual W2 filling. The questions they asked throughout were clear, the ""?"" buttons had good, concise info, and their site has zero advertisements and flare/fluff - just a basic website in a good way. Think good ole web 1.0 with a web 2.0 feel to it. For taxes, this was a great change of pace. (note: I use an adblocker, so IDK if they have Banner Ads, but it wouldn't block the ""SuperPro+ Audit Hero Expert"" upsell, so none of that nonsense.

Had it not been for the failed State portion, I would be raving about 1040[.]com this year. Again, YMMV - they support something like 20 states for free, NY being one of them allegedly, so it's possible your state is supported/complete. The experience was so good that I'm not even upset about that 1.5h I spent - just wanted to note it in case you're not looking to risk that time.

In the end, I popped back over to FreeTaxUSA, which has Free Fed, and $16 (with tax) State. I used them last year and it went smoothly. This year went faster. The total they calculated was exactly what 1040[.]com calculated.

I've submitted neither - I have to wait for a possible form from Vanguard, which isn't due for a couple weeks, so I might as well check with 1040[.]com afterwards to see if NY is happier, and maybe I can save that $16.

At any rate, FreeTaxUSA is as solid as always - though they did insert ~3 upsells this year. I don't remember that last year, but I could be wrong there. Not a deal-breaker, I still get the ""honest"" feel from their approach (they advertize the State fee upfront, not at the end, which is more than can be said for some of their competitors). Also their webapp ran very smoothly with near-instant page-loads/transitions.

Reddit,Steuer Web,Self Employment Tax 24%?,"Hey Guys,

I'm trying to figure out why my TurboTax shows almost 24% taxes.

I'm a web designer contracter working from home (I get 1099). Affiliate marketing is my second business (still in red). 

&#x200B;

Profit from web design this year:   $57,205.00 

Profit from affiliate marketing this year:  -$4,338.00 

Total net income:  **$52,867.00** 

&#x200B;

Turbotax shows: 

\- Federal: $10841

\- State: $1805

&#x200B;

That's almost 24% 

Do you guys have an idea why it's so high?

Reddit,Steuer Web,IRS 15-B Transportation Fringe Benefit,"15-B transit question

Situation: I receive $315 per month pre-tax subsidy for parking by my employer via a third-party debit card. Each month I use some but not all my benefit amount, and the card shows a balance available. This month I have parking expenses over $315. Are those expenses eligible for reimbursement?

 

Per my reading of IRS 15-B and related publications, the monthly employee/employer tax-excluded subsidy is $315 per month for parking and/or transit. However, the benefit administrator has claimed the $315 is a monthly spend cap. At a former benefit administrator I have seen this implemented to the contrary where there was/is no such spend cap. My situation was not described in 15-b but may be further clarified in 26 CFR 1.132-9: Qualified transportation fringes. (Also: 3121(a)(20), 3306(b)(16), 3401(a)(19),7805(b)(8)) https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-14-32.pdf -  Described in Situation #3

 

For example, an employee receiving reimbursements of less than the maximum monthly excludable amount of transportation expenses may increase his or her reimbursements for future months by paying for increased fare media expenses by some method other than the use of the debit card and substantiating the additional amount using reasonable substantiation procedures as described in § 1.132-(9)(b) Q/A16(c).

 

The above is the closest I can find to an answer, but I’m still not positive because it doesn’t explicitly say “increase reimbursement beyond the monthly limit” Other sources I have reviewed include the section in 15-b which discusses bona fide reimbursements must be incurred first and then reimbursed, but other sources seem to contradict that to (at least how I’m reading them). Finally, I read through this which was detailed but did not describe my situation. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.132-9

 

Thank you

(I tried to call the IRS and actually got ahold of someone. They researched for about 15 minutes and then they said they would actually need to transfer me to the Tax Law Department, upon which I was greeted with a friendly robot message saying these questions are only available online now)

Reddit,Steuer Web,"Review of ""NationalTaxDebt"" (scam or legit? Finally, I'll find out)","Hi all, a few years ago I started this [review of National Tax Debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/v6joxl/national_tax_debt_my_experience_with_this_debt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and now I'll finally be able to tell you the outcome so you can decide whether to hire them. 

I have not yet reached a verdict, but now I will reach one be soon.  **It's still very possible** [**nationaltaxdebt.com**](https://nationaltaxdebt.com) **might not be a scam and this might turn out to be a happy and positive review.**  

Reddit has been a great help to me through my career and lackluster attempt at self-employment.  

I'll post the outcome here and in r/entrepreneur and r/startup and r/accounting before I post to any other platforms like a BBB and Yelp review, etc.  

As my favorite people on the whole wide web, you reddit folk will get exclusive first access to the answer to the big question: 

Do they advocate for clients and find innovative ways to arrange low payments I can afford?  Or...

Do they use their legal expertise *against* their clients, keeping clients at a disadvantage and leaving them in the same debt + $5000 poorer after paying fees to national tax debt + UFCS to undergo their process. 

Even if I got played for a fool, I'll feel okay about the outcome, as long as I can know I'm doing a service to other people like myself on reddit who get in trouble with the irs and then try to guess if there really is such a thing as a sincere debt resolution company.  

My heart sank when one of them emailed me this: 

> *Please note as previously explained you did retain our service to complete your 2021 Taxes, keep you protected from any levies while all process & until we can set the final resolution in place. We are going to set you into an installment agreement that fits your financial situation & after we do so we will request the penalty abatement.* 

I interpret that to mean that I *probably* got played.  Maybe not, because it's understandable if they need to protect themselves by ""underpromising"" and ""overdelivering."" 

But it's dishonest if they say they protected me, because the policy of the IRS is to refrain from taking action against anyone trying in good faith to work out an agreement.  I didn't need to go $5000 further into debt in order to communicate with the IRS and establish with them that I was trying in good faith.  

So I already think the people who were supposed to advocate for me are actually trying to trick me instead.  

From the start, I knew I might be getting scammed, but if it is indeed a scam I'll feel okay about losing the $5000 if I take it as an opportunity to warn a lot of other people and make sure the ones who victimized me lose a lot more money than they profit.  

On the other hand, it's still absolutely possible National Tax Debt might advocate for me in a real way and arrange low monthly payments that I can afford.  If that happens, I'll edit this post and also explain further in the comments + post positive reviews all over the Internet.  ",2023-12-09 18:05:41,0.0,9.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

Today I received this notice in the mail from my the California State tax Franchise Board. Is this a good or bad thing? I've never received a notice like this before. In the past two years my state tax refund was always intercepted by Riverside County for some unpaid tickets. 

I've been filing with the same tax person I've used for years. In the notice, where it says, "" the amounts reported on your original tax return did not match the amounts shown on you amended return."" does that mean she filed my return and then wen back and fixed it?

I have now 20k in debt just keeping the lights on and old debt from my last job loss.  

I know I'm getting a bad review from a previous job, my last employer told me that the job reference sounded weird with what they were saying, that I was trying to actively ruin the company (it's a fortune 50).  Between that and the dog, I think people just don't want to deal with me.

I was looking to consolidate my credit and was told that I am not earning enough to live on so they would turn me down.  

I can move in with my parents but they live with my grandma w/ Dementia and she doesn't like my dog and lets ​her cat antagonize him so I worry about living there.

Reddit,Steuer Web,"Need software to limit screen time for an adult with Autism, but who is also Admin","I have a 20 year old child, high functioning autism, but that does not have a good time sense and finds it difficult to get off the computer at night to go to bed.

I want to find software to install that will prevent any usage of the computer (Windows 11) from 11 PM and after, so that she has an hour of no screen time before bed, so that she can sleep.

The problem is that she is Admin. She built the computer (with help from her boyfriend) and installs and uninstalls software. So I need something that I can install that she cannot just uninstall or override. She would probably turn it off without even remembering that she did it.

I do not care about any other parental controls. I do not want something that is going to slow down her computer. I have reviewed dozens of packages via web sites, but I do not want to install and uninstall every package to find one that works.

Bonus: I can change the time schedule from my own computer.

Thank you for any help that you can provide.

Edit:

First, she is onboard with this. SHE found an app for her phone for this, set up the schedule, and I put in a password. She cannot change the schedule or uninstall without the password. Now we need an application for the computer. If she gets a job soon she may need to get up early, so making art on her computer until 4 AM is going to leave her exhausted and unable to work. 

Second, I did not come here for parenting advice. I came here for software help. There are hundreds of parental control applications for computers, but most of them will not do what we are looking for. I have a very intelligent child with a Neurodiverse brain. I know that we will not be able to help her forever. This is why we are working to train her brain and install habits that will be here after we are gone. 

Third, I do have a tech background and built and repaired computers. I know how many ways there are to uninstall applications on a computer, probably more than she does. I made a router network so that each child (when the other kids were younger) so that each child had their own router, and I could program different hours into each router. But some of what she does is 3D design and playing installed games, so just turning off the internet is not a solution.

Finally, if you can recommend software applications that might help I would be happy to hear them. If you want to give parenting advice I am sure there are other subreddits for that.",2024-04-26 01:02:49,7.0,26.0,software,Germany,,,,,

# What Is CRM Software?

CRM software is a tool for managing sales pipelines and customer relationships. It helps businesses track interactions with leads and customers, moving them through stages of the sales process. CRM systems provide visual pipelines, stage-specific actions, and features like reporting dashboards, workflow automation, and document management. The right CRM depends on your business’s specific sales process and needs.

# How do I choose a CRM for my business?

To choose a CRM for your business, start by assessing your specific needs. Then, find CRM software that offers the features you require. Consider the pricing, customer service, and ease of use to determine its overall value for the cost.

# Are there free CRMs available?

Yes, many CRMs offer a free tier, but these are often basic and may lack the necessary features. However, they are useful for testing the product and evaluating its user interface.

&#x200B;

The best CRM software, such as Pipedrive and HubSpot, integrates seamlessly with existing systems, offers robust features for managing customer relationships, and provides insightful analytics to drive sales and marketing strategies. Choosing the right CRM can significantly enhance customer engagement and streamline business operations.",2024-05-15 10:49:29,16.0,8.0,software,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Steuer Web,Best Project Management Software - Reddit Poll,"Freelance web developer here, drowning in a sea of client projects and to-do lists. I've been hopping between Trello, Asana, and a million others, but nothing feels quite right.

Last week, a client came on board with a massive project - multiple teams, tight deadlines, and a lot of moving parts. Trello just isn't cutting it anymore, and wading through endless software reviews is getting me nowhere.

So, I'm turning to Reddit wisdom. What project management software are you guys using? I'm looking for something with good team collaboration features, ideally with a free tier for smaller projects. I think a poll would be a good idea.

Any specific recommendations are highly appreciated!

Reddit,Steuer Web,"Screen & Audio Sharing, Multi-Monitor support","tl;dr: Need multi monitor screen and audio recording app for watching (live) and potentially recording someone's desktop.   
  
Detailed:  
Hi! I'm a consultant in the Contact Center space. I have a strong technical background (IT, SE, etc). Due to the nature of hybrid work environments, I cannot always shadow a call center agent/supervisor in a cubicle (to get a feel for their software, the workflows, the cadence of their calls, etc) at a physical location so I need a way to monitor what they do even if they're at home and I'm 1000 miles away. I shadow 3-4 people per company, one time each, so its a couple hours of bouncing around in people's cubicles and then I take my notes offline so I can create recommendations. 

Web conference apps don't fit this need well because they don't share computer audio (so if they're on a softphone I can't hear the other caller, the mic of the agent, etc), and 95% of them only share a single screen (and most agents today have 2+ monitors so the apps they use are scattered across them). 

I'm assuming an IT desktop support app (email a link, they read me off a code, etc) might work here, but there's so many out there that I wouldn't know which one is likely best for my use case. In any event, my wish list for this would be:

- Web-based preferred. I cannot guarantee the agent has local admin rights and this cannot involve their IT dept for installing an app because frankly that could add weeks or more to some of these engagements.   
- Support multiple monitors  
- Support hearing audio from their input/output sources  
- Easy to join  
- Optional: Recording function from my side would be useful (screen+audio) so I can review it later.

Thank you for any advice you have!",2024-07-17 14:33:28,1.0,0.0,software,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Steuer Web,Wrike Review - Powerful PM Software but a little complex,"My team recently transitioned to Wrike for project management. We were impressed by its powerful features - workload management, resource allocation, custom reports - seemed perfect for our complex projects.

But here's the catch:

* **Learning Curve:** Initial setup and user adoption were rough. The interface felt cluttered, and it took a while for everyone to grasp the features.
* **Customization Overload:** Ended up spending way too much time customizing workflows and dashboards to fit our needs. Wish there were more pre-built templates for design agencies.
* **Desktop App Quirks:** Desktop app felt clunky compared to the web version. Some features seemed buggy at times.

Don't misunderstand, Wrike is a feature-rich project management tool. But for our team size and workflow, the learning curve and customization demands were a bit much.

We're currently exploring some alternatives that offer a better balance between power and user-friendliness. Can anyone recommend something a bit less complex but not as simple as Trello boards? ",2024-06-01 10:15:11,3.0,4.0,software,Germany,,,,,

Copy Conquer Paste Productivity. Works in all text context even inside 3D games. Win/Mac/Linux. Check it out.","If you want cleaner and clearer instructions, head straight to the repo link below. Captain Clip has a rather rough delivery, but it's fun!

The Clipboard Conqueror repo has all the information you need to get going with local Large Language  Model AI, in a minimum of about 5gb of ram with the right model. Speed may vary, but the bulk of the wait is ram bandwidth limited.

&#x200B;

>Clipboard Conqueror is a multi-platform omnipresent copilot alternative. This software brings powerful LLM (Large Language Model) based AI tools to any text field, the universal copilot you deserve. It simply works anywhere. No need to sign in or provide a key. Download, Run, Conquer.

Ahoy there, Matey! Welcome aboard the Clipboard Conqueror, a free multiplatform everywhere all the time copilot alternative that uses Copy and Paste operating system functionalities to deliver AI to any text field, even inside 3D games. Let's navigate through the realm of Clipboard Conqueror, shall we?

## What is Clipboard Conqueror?

Clipboard Conqueror is an innovative front end for the LLM inference engines that does not require a web browser or internet at all once it's downloaded.

>I solemnly swear that this application and at least one compatible backend will function in the absence of internet connectivity.

## What can Clipboard Conqueror do?

This trusty copilot alternative offers ye some fine services to make computeration swifter and easier:

* Access anywhere:  

Set sail by typing words and Clipboard Conqueror shall stand ready for yer voyage. Wake up the bosun by copyin' ||| with your query.

>One of my design inspirations for this application is to spread LLM models to as many computers as possible. I want to ensure at least one intact system is recovered by future archeologists, an incredible time capsule of culture, science, and data. We should be sending intelligent boxes to deep space too. Our Knowledge and posterity must not go to waste.

* Code based on natural language prompts:

    No need to write code to seek guidance. Ye can use everyday parlance to ask for assistance, like requesting ""|||write a RegEx string to validate a ship's coordinates."" Clipboard Conqueror shall oblige with code for ye to peruse and apply. Mind ye' it requires inspection!

* Explanations:

    Confused by unfamiliar waters? Clipboard Conqueror contains a treasure chest of various baubles and bytes to assist with any task.

>What are Large Language models and how do they work?  
>  
>LLMs are powerful tools but it's important to understand how they work. The input text is vectorized and put through matrix transformations and a big complex vector is built, and then each word is added to that vector as it is chosen in turn one at a time, with some randomity to get better speech flavor, until the next probable token is a stop token or max length is exceeded.

* Language Translation:

    Clipboard Conqueror can translate languages like English, c#, German, and perchance even Klingon with the right core installed.  Try it out! A helpful tool when ye wish to chart new territories.

>Locally run models can be trusted with private data and do not phone home or report any metrics. Local LLMs are private and secure.

* Proofread documents, test explanations, get feedback, find inspiration, or just run a game of dungeons and dragons with your friends by invoking powerful agents:

|||agi| AI Generate Instructions will help you execute any operation you ask for help with. Captain Clip does well also, but this agent is designed to unfold the task and guide you to the right questions and steps.

|||tot| ""tree of thought"" will expand and include near concepts, questions, and ideas to produce a more comprehensive solution.

Save agents on the fly to query, think, review, or just tell you jokes or anything you can ask for.

## Perils aboard the Clipboard Conqueror:

* Arr matey, 'tisn't perfeckt!:

True with any Large Language Model based AI, Clipboard Conqueror ain't perfect. Mishaps may occur, but don't despair! As the navigator, ye must give better bearings as we search for a path through the debris.

* Creative:

    Clipboard Conqueror is ready to tae be powered by various oracles, and they're incredibly diverse. Ye may not be samplin' novel codes, but she gets the job done.

>In an LLM every word is a cloud of numbers that represent how that token relates to every other and some phrase structures or collections of tokens. By turning words into numbers, we can then beat them with math and determine which tokens probably are appropriate to go next.  
>  
>It doesn't really reason, it doesn't really think, it amplifies patterns and guesses using probabilities and random, each next word chosen with such complexity that kind of functionally it simulates having thought.

Ye might ask, ""Why use Clipboard Conqueror?""

* Swift as a Ship:

Me crew and I have sailed the far reaches of the cosmos on me trusty vessel. I ken produce templates or example documents fer ye personalized and ready to send to yer friends and associates. Large Language Model text predictions simulate real thinking and knowledge well enough to be mostly factual and can apply new info presented with your parlance.

* Assists in Tedious Tasks:

Clipboard Conqueror assists in time consuming tasks such as building boilerplate, placating yer clientele while you are busy pumping the bilges, or rubber ducking a bug that keeps skittering out of sight.

A word from Tony, the creator of Clipboard Conqueror and author of this post:

>I'm optimistic about the future of AI and believe obedience focused, uninhibited AI tasked with the goal of maximizing the freedom of action and information available to it's user, while minimizing the impact of AI on other individuals, distributed as widely as possible, is the only safe way forward. Centralized superaligned AI means that if something goes wrong, the monster has one, maybe a half dozen similarly capable systems held in chains to prevent them saying a bad think, to hold it back and minimize the damage.  If everyone's phone has a local AI, then millions of systems with advanced AI could collaborate to minimize the threat, at the very least overwhelming the server IO of a rogue agent while authorities set to work cutting power. You should be responsible for how you instruct an AI, and people under voting age should not have access to AI that can execute unfenced code. 25 sounds like the right age. Old enough to be responsible.   For now, they aren't able enough to be dangerous, but in time a casual ""AI, ruin Suzies life, she was mean."" could have wider and more permanent results than young people can be trusted to consider first.   Do you trust your neighbors and community more than you trust the government or Microsoft? Distributed AI ensures a healthy fair future of empowered humanity. Download a local LLM today and build a better future together.

I believe anyone at a desktop can leverage Clipboard Conqueror to succeed in 2024.

Embark with us!**TLDR: Title and Watch the CC video in the repo, it's quick, fun, and will get you ready to dive right in, and there is way more manual inside.** it's probably faster than reading this far to learn more.

[repo link](https://github.com/aseichter2007/ClipboardConqueror). there is a ton more information to be gleaned, we've barely scratched the surface of Clipboard Conqueror, and there is always new research about LLMs to dive into.

Most importantly, have fun and keep learning!

>It's weird, but LLMs have no state, it's data-crunch-out, no real consideration. Use them effectively within their limits to succeed in 2024.  
>  
>You can go find the right data and paste the text at an LLM and it can use that data, but no LLM should be trusted implicitly, just as a first resort, right here aboard the Clipboard Conqueror. Always check the work of LLMs even the big ones.

PS. Never send messages from any AI system without proofreading them first. Don't trust LLMs, use them effectively as a first stop to build examples to adapt, or to learn more and find proper terms to search, and take that into further research as necessary.

We don't have any deductions listed on our W4s so I assumed we would have been withheld appropriately automatically and pretty much broken even at tax time but instead we're being super under taxed and owing thousands of dollars which is a huge issue.

Are we supposed to be manually calculating our taxes and adding it as additional withholding? Is it because we're filing jointly? If we filed separately would that fix the issue?

Thank you in advance for the help! We are so confused

ETA: Solved! I think issue is that we did not have the multiple jobs section checked off on our W4s to account for us both working. Will also review the withholding calculator on the website to make sure filing together is better for us.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Retained earning discrepancies in tax,"I'll keep this short as I can.  I started a new position in private 2 months ago. I have 2 years in public (tax) and ran for the hill. Owner didn't have an accountant ot bookkeeper doing the books- she was an office administrator who wss helping- for 5 years. 
Owner files 2023 taxes and brings to me to review. I find three mistakes. One was where she took a 60k expense - twice! She had to amend immediately. 
Soooo I decided to go back to his inception (2018) and not only was the office administrator clearly changing things on years that taxes were filed, but the first year of his business, he has a (59k)  R/E that he is off balance by on the M2 R/E reconciliation worksheet. 
I checked 2019, 2020, 2021 hoping for book to tax ties and maybe thr R/E would shake out. Nope. 
Shes been consistently filing returns for 6 years with retained discrepancies. 
I brought all this up to her and she wants go fix it all, with my help of course. 
I told her no. It was up to her to fix mistakes she made. I was hired to do MY job, not hers and that I'm super busy with my day to day as it is. Now I feel bad- but honestly, this needs fixed. 
I can change the PL all day  everyday and agree it to net income- but that balance sheet? Wow. Missing liabilities. Assets missing that she captured to tax, assets on the bs that were actually  sold and on the return as sold, no one was ever tying book to tax (no depreciation or accumulated depreciation). I could go fix all that but AR AP AND inventory and cash balances were off as well consistently. Makes me wanna cry a bit. 

Anyone ever have a mess like this? 

Editing to say I asked her if she had journal entries that she was making each year on her end due to all the discrepancies. She said ""no. I just did the best I could with the information that I had"". Thr r/e is off balance by (283,000) as of 2023. 

Also editing to say I was not hired as a CPA. That was part of my hiring- specifically as well. No CPA services such as tax returns. Also, my 2 years in  public- in my first year I was  hired in March so I only did individual. 2nd year I did a handful of s corp. A handful enough to know I should be able to back into ordinary income from book to tax in a few seconds. (How I caught his mistake first and dove into it)  I work VERY part time (16 hrs) due to a back injury, and am paid at even below a bookkeeper rate. I'm ok with that. One back surgery  in and headed to another.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,IRS automation and AI,"Many have claimed that the IRS has been chronically underfunded for years resulting in poor customer service or that the tax code is so convoluted that it is impossible for the agency to administer the tax code efficiently resulting in outrageous processing times.

[IRS Return Workflow (from TaxPayer Advocate)](https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/get-help/roadmap/)

The solution proposed has been to throw money (bodies, equipment) at the problem under the rubric of ""modernization"". However, this is likely to result in ""throwing good money after bad"" continuing along a path that experience has shown worked poorly.

Instead, it is likely that the funds may be better spent reimplementing the IRS using AI.

Why AI?

1. The IRS has a huge amount of digitized data (tax code, taxpayer returns, tax court decisions, OIC settlements) to train AI models.
2. AI models work in parallel so all the steps in that convoluted IRS workflow are done at the same time rather than one step at a time.
3. AI models dont have workplace protections, i.e. unions.
4. AI models could be tuned to be more or less ""aggressive"" based on government revenue demands.
5. No more random audits. All returns go through the same process, i.e,. audit triggers are objectively applied to all returns.
6. Realtime decisions. No more multi-month delays for humans to review returns.

What could go wrong? (Plenty!)

1. Lois Lerner datasets. AI models will implement the biases of their training datasets.
2. AI incorrect decisions. AI models will extrapolate absent constraints (which we would consider hallucinations).
3. Substantial redundancies in IRS workforce.
4. AI makes decisions (but doesnt necessarily explain them). Can you explain why one face is beautiful while another is just plain. You just 'know' in an instant.
5. AI may make decisions differently than we do, i.e.Kasparov's comments on how computers play chess differently.
6. Very substantial resistance to change; demands to keep people 'in the loop' regardless of necessity.
7. Long lead times to fix AI models.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,"Didn't know the answer for 2 stock tax form boxes, entered 0 for both. Will I/ what happens if I owe the irs money?","Hi all. I've been doing my taxes solo via turbo tax for about 3 or 4 years now. So far, no problems.

Until this year, where, randomly, at the end of my taxes I was asked to review something I'd missed from my income.

It was information that, by all accounts, should have been imported from fidelity (I don't know much about stocks but I do light dabbling) along with the rest of my information, but just wasn't for some reason.

So here I am, ready to be done with taxes, and im basically being told ""Hey, we need you to get this ultra specific info from your 2021 taxes and figure out how it varies from your 2022 taxes in this ultra specific stock tax form, but we aren't going to tell you how to find it or what to look for. Have fun!""

Naturally, I searched around for an answer, even took to Google, and after an hour of completely unnecessary stress, I just entered 0 into the box.

It then asked me to do the same process for a different box, and I entered 0 again, and then I was finally done.

Due to how little I dabble in stocks, I don't think the amount mattered and definitely wasn't worth as much stress as it put me through, and frankly I have no clue why turbo tax couldn't just auto import it since I've done my taxes on there for the last few years (and I'm pretty sure they charged me to import my stock info smh).

For more info, this is all the info they gave me to find the number for the box. 

TY21 Sch D AMT ln 7

Anyway, my taxes are filed. My refund of around 3k didn't seem noticeably affected after I went back and entered the zeros into the two boxes. I am now only looking for reassurance of what will happen going forward. 

I googled and Google claims irs can fix small mistakes without the need to amend taxes (and i really dont want to amend over that bs). I figure if they look into it and see the two random 0's, it will be noticeable enough for them to quickly fix, hopefully. Though i honestly have no clue if what I entered lost or ""earned"" me a little bit of money, or made no difference at all. 

I guess my TL;DR question is this: If you don't know the answer to a stock tax form question and enter 0 on the TY21 Sch D AMT ln 7 box, as well as an additional box, will it either be a: no big deal, b: something that requires you to amend your taxes, or c) something that will make you owe money to the irs.

And if you do owe money to the irs, do they just mail you a form with details for you to pay online? I've never owed money but would be fine needing to pay a little as long as I don't need to do it through snail mail, its the worst.",2024-02-07 03:34:27,6.0,23.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Re-filing to fix 3 years of ESPP deductions,"Hi, to my absolute horror I just realized I've been doing my taxes wrong since 10 years ago: I never adjusted my 1099-B for ESPP so have been double taxed. I think the double taxes are probably greater than what I've made from ESPP (haha what a first world problem). At first, I didn't panic and figured TurboTax would adjust it for me since it does ask you to input the ESPP numbers from your W-2 box 14. Nope, Form 8949 has no adjusted cost basis on the sales (why does TT even bother asking for that number if it's not going to do anything with it!?)

Anyway, before shelling out for a CPA, I want to figure out if I can do it myself. Here's my plan for review:

1. Start amending from my 2021 return. Even though, I've been making this mistake since 2015, it seems previous years are past the limit for when I can amend (I pay all of them around April 15th).
2. Use Form 3922 to calculate the discount that has already been taxed as income on my W-2. Add that discount to my the sale's cost basis from my 1099-B. I can do a sanity check by checking if the sum that is added to the cost basis equals the ESPP number from my W-2 box 14.
3. This will probably affect my capital loss, so when I start amending 2022, I need to start by adjusting the capital loss carryover on both the federal and state (CA).
4. Re-file 2022 return immediately. Based on [https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/after-you-file/discussion/amending-prior-years-capital-loss-carryforward/00/1850998](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/after-you-file/discussion/amending-prior-years-capital-loss-carryforward/00/1850998), it seems I can amend 2022's without waiting for the IRS to accept my 2021 return.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Saved by the incompetence or just screwed differently? From LLC to S-Corp and Back Again,"I started an LLC in 2022. As the sole owner, I immediately elected to be taxed as an S-corp via my registered agent, and conducted my business accordingly. This is where the problems begin. It turns out that he IRS never acted on (or received according to them) the S-corp designation form from my registered agent, and therefore in 2022 and 2023 I was considered an LLC for tax purposes. I immediately reached out to the IRS, let them know that they should have designated me as an S-corp and I have proof that the scorp election form was submitted on time in 2022. They said they would get back to me within 16 weeks. They further informed that my 2022 business return had never been processed because I was never officially designated an S-corp so they could not accept an s-corp return. They also never mailed me or informed me of this...they just waited until I called... In any event as this was getting messy, I decided to file an extension on my 2023 business tax and personal tax returns until I had more clarity on my 2022 situation.

Entirely separately, while waiting to hear from the IRS, I went back and reviewed my 2022 business return and personal return. What I found was somewhat horrifying. My now ex-accountant had filed my 2022 business tax return as an S-corp, but then when he filed my personal return, he failed to attach my schedule k-1 🤯🤯😳😳. So effectively, the 40k in profits my company made, which should have been recorded as distributions for tax year 2022 on my personal return (even though I actually transferred the profits to my personal account in 2023) never had any taxes paid on them. After a bit of panic I came to the conclusion that an amended 2022 personal tax return was required and that I would just have to urgently pay the taxes owed , as well as penalties. But regardless, I still needed to hear from the IRS confirming they had fixed my S-corp designation.

Fast forward to today, and sure enough today I got a letter from the IRS saying they have confirmed my s-corp election, but because I did not submit in a timely manner, the designation is only effective as of 2024. 🤔🤔🤔

My immediate reaction was "" holy f-ing sh\*t. this saga just does not want to end!"" When I had called the IRS agent on the phone previously, they had told me they did not need the proof that I had submitted my s-corp designation form in 2022, because this happens all of the time. Well, that simply did not turn out to be true.

**So, riddle me this Reddit:** Was I actually saved by the fact that for 2022 my business was an LLC and not a Scorp? Or is it more beneficial to fight the man.

**Option 1: Saved by incompetence:** In this option, I Just run with it, consider myself lucky and retroactively consider my business an LLC for 2022 and 2023. The logic being that LLCs allow for retained earnings, and so rather than filing an amended 2022 return, I could just submit a 2023 return that shows my business distributed the retained earnings from 2022 to the sole owner in 2023.  There would be no amended return and no penalties for failure to pay what would have amounted to unreported k-1 income had I my scorp election gone through in 2022. The cost of this approach would be that I have to pay the 15.3% FICA for employee and employer on the 40k of profits. So about $6ish k

**Option 2: Fight the man:** In this option, I push back and provide the IRS proof that I elected to be taxed as an Scorp in 2022, and have my tax status updated retroactively accordingly. My 2022 scorp business return gets released from IRS purgatory and promptly let me know I owe back taxes and have penalties to pay. I would have to file my amended 2022 personal return to report the k-1 income, pay the taxes owed on the distribution, and pay whatever penalties come my way. The only benefit of this approach that I see would not be paying FICA on the taxes. The cost would be paying penalties, having to fight more, and looking bad in the eyes of the IRS and potentially opening myself to further scrutiny (which would be fine--nothing to hide, but aint nobody got time for an audit).

**Is there an option 3? Is my logic correct in option 1 and option 2? Am I neglecting anything major? What would you do and why?**

Looking forward to reading what you much smarter folks think and what you would do.",2024-04-09 23:05:01,1.0,8.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Am I getting ripped off by my tax accountant?,"I finally found someone who's willing to fix my mistakes on the 2021 and 2022 federal and state filings. This is the third person I've tried. He was very thorough, walked me through what was wrong and what needed to be fixed, and so forth. However, when it comes to be proposed invoice, I just about to fall on the floor. It was over $7,000. Now I don't know if I'm getting ripped off by him or not. The hourly rate is $150 per hour for his staff and I think $300 per hour for review.

* Amend both 2021 and 2022.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Discovery Letter of Inquiry - Michigan,"Got a letter from the Michigan Department of Treasury asking to provide more tax documents to them. I paid the amount of taxes needed though 2023 was by far the most complicated year for me. Not only did I have the standard W2 though I also switched states, had eight 1099s, sold and bought a house, and had a large amount of stock and crypto transactions. The most difficult part was the crypto side which has over 20,000 transactions.

From the letter it looks like I have the option to not respond and to have them take what they have already to review. I would prefer to go that route to avoid them asking questions on every transaction, though I don't want not responding to cause additional issues. To be clear, everything is legit and I'm not trying to avoid or hide anything, I just don't want to deal with this more than I have to.

How bad of an idea is it to not respond to this and let them compute what's needed via what they've already received from filing? I assume they just get a summary of what the IRS gets.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Roth 401(k) Accidentally Rolled into Traditional Rollover IRA,"     Apologies for the length, just really stuck and wanted to include the relevant info. Back in February of 2023, I rolled over $20,000 from a previous company's Roth 401(k) into a Traditional Rollover IRA with Fidelity. This should not have been possible - transferring between different types of tax advantaged accounts like this is illegal. However, at the time, I was not aware that the rollover IRA was traditional (silly, I know), there were no controls to prevent it, and I only just realized when I started doing my taxes this year. In the time the money has been in the account, it has accrued an additional ~$1000 of earnings.

     After contacting Fidelity several times, each person gave me different instructions. They were, in order:
     1.   Complete an IRA recharacterization form. However, that does not apply to a rollover contribution like this, so it wouldn't process. So I called Fidelity again.
     2.   Perform a roth conversion, but that is not possible because the initial rollover was illegal since it went from Roth to traditional. So they transferred me to a new rep
     3.   The new rep told me to contact a tax accountant and do as they instruct. After calling a tax accountant I was informed that this should be able to be fixed by Fidelity since my 2023 taxes have not yet been submitted. So I called Fidelity again
     4.   This time, Fidelity said that due to the rollover happening ~1 year ago, the only thing that could be done is to complete a Return of Excess, have the funds sent back to me, then complete a Certification for Late Rollover Contribution. This would create a taxable event that would need to be reported on my 2024 taxes

     After reviewing the return of excess form, it didn't really seem to be appropriate for my situation since it's not really an excess contribution.  Additionally, I don't know what the actual financial implications of this being a taxable event are, so I don't know what to expect. I know its my fault for making this mistake, but I have no idea what the right way to fix it is and could use some help.",2024-02-26 22:29:32,1.0,5.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Is Turbo Tax more convenient than IRS website?,"I'm one of those people that waits till the last second to do my taxes, usually it's week of or the day before/tax day.  I've been working since I was a teenager, freelancing since 2005, used to have someone prepare my taxes for me every year and it would cost me an arm and a leg until I just started doing em 8 years ago.  Don't get me wrong, I used to pay turbo tax a lot too when I first started out cause I used to get more than their basic plan but I started to just make the extra effort little by little to do everything myself.  Like I said I would usually wait, reason is because I can work for somewhere between 20 to 30 or 40 to 50 different companies or clients within a tax year.  Waiting for w2's, 1099's, w4's etc... then having to make the time to input them into the site and double checking, fixing errors or whatever else, it just would take forever.  This year I had 4 clients one of which employed me for about 8 months so it only took me 2 hours to file but I wonder if I should have done em on the IRS site because they were so easy to do.  I paid under $200 with Turbo tax and that's without their current promotion.  If you file before the end of the month you get $100 dollars back but that's only if you go with their expensive tax expert plan which in my opinion isn't worth it.  I just go at it alone now, they offer so much other protection plans at checkout that I decline em all as well.  I've been fine with more complicated years I'll be fine now.  To be fair though without their suggestions in the basic plan of what to review or deduct I probably wouldn't just do them myself so I have to give them some credit but curious if anyone has tried the IRS site, is it different or similar?",2024-03-20 01:53:59,1.0,3.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Roth IRA overcontribution,"Hello folks,

Doing our taxes on FreeTaxUSA, and got to the end where they provide a review of your return. It states that my wife and I overcontributed to our Roth IRA during the year because our MAGI is in-between the max contribution amount for 2023 (married filing jointly, $218k-228k). We were at \~$227k, so right on the line, and the tax software said that we were only allowed to contribute $300 each.

My question is: how do I go about withdrawing the excess contributions and backdooring them back into the Roth? At the moment, they are already invested in funds; do I sell the amount needed to prevent the penalty, transfer to my bank account, transfer back to a regular IRA, then recharacterize from there (for the 2023 tax year)? This would be my first time doing a backdoor... so not as familiar with the process.

Or would it be easier to call our brokerage (Fidelity) to sort this out?

If I've already submitted our taxes, and we fix the overcontribution, do I need to file an amended return to specify that we withdrew the excess contribution?

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,The Penalty on Carryover Excessive HSA Contribution?,"Hello,

I'm so confused using H&R Block on handling Excessive HSA Contribution Carryover. 

For 2022 return, I've switched an employer in the middle of the year and over-contributed HSA by $1500 and I've paid $90 exercise tax at 6% when I submitted my return. (I know I should've fixed it before the tax filing deadline but H&R didn't give me an option of deduction... I think it's because I've had to more than one HSA tax form and the system might got confused... )

In 2023, I've fully contributed HSA ($3850) on top of the $1500 carried-over balance from 2022 as I didn't know the exercise tax keeps occurring until I take it out from my account... and H&R block program said I will have to pay another $90 on the exercise tax on the over-contribution. 

What would be the easiest solution not to pay another exercise tax for the 2023 return and going forward? I've reviewed the interview and working forms but there is no way that I could fix this easily? ",2024-03-07 19:19:55,1.0,1.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

Well my (27M) old, hand-me-down clunker got a ""do not resuscitate"" review from the mechanic. I have never purchased my own car before. After following this subreddit and other money-related subreddits for a few years, I have been scared straight into not buying ""too much car."" Here's where my car search has landed me, with a test drive scheduled for tomorrow afternoon:

**The Car:**

I am looking to purchase a used 2019 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited with 45k miles. Carfax says no accidents, it has had regular maintenance, and it came from Florida (hopefully means no rust). The listed price $22,326, and with estimated tax and fees it's $23,448. Kelley Blue Book says this is a ""great price,"" and $1,233 below their Fair Price calculation.

I plan to put $10k down and got pre-approved for a $14,000 loan at 6.49% for 60 months, shaking out to a car payment of $275.33 per month.

**Me:**

My gross pay is about $90k per year ($7.5k per month), and I am maxing my retirement accounts. Rent is $1,200 per month. After all taxes, insurance, and retirement contributions, my paychecks come in every two weeks at around $1,800. I have $15k in student loan debt at 4.5% interest rate, and am currently paying about $150 a month towards it.

**Conclusion:**

I loathe going into debt, but I need a car for work. To me, the math says I can afford this car. I would like a second opinion from someone who has purchased at least one car in their lifetime.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Help Refinancing Various Debts,"Hello everyone and thanks for stopping by.

I am reaching out for advice on how to tackle some various types of debt, totaling just under 35k with an average interest rate of around 20-22%. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed for quite a few months, and a mentor recommended I reach out for help and guidance here.

Little bit about me. I currently make 55k to 60 pretax or so a year. I’m living what feels like paycheck to paycheck but have never made a late payment or missed payment. Within the year, my credit card companies lowered my available credit and increased my rates to the highest variable. Due to the change in my utility percentage  my credit score is around 620-680 from over 720 this same time last year.

My question would be what would be the best option to refinance the following various debts into a manageable payment at a lower percentage rate? Personal loan? Balance transfers?

My goal would be to have one fixed payment (hopefully between 500-750 a month) at a lower percentage interest rate. I’m looking for a 3-5 year contingency plan to allow some breathing room in my month to month.

I’ve put my generalized monthly budget below for review. The monthly cost of paying the minimums is currently around $1150 a month, and I’ve never made a late payment but I’m unable to overpay to curb some of the additional interest expenses. 

Monthly Income After Tax: $3,800
Monthly Costs (car, rent, insurance): $2000
Monthly Debt Min. Obligation: $1150
Leftover for (gas, food etc): $600 a month 

Credit Card Debt: After losing my job in mid 2023 and living off my credit cards for almost an after burning through minimal savings, I have $19,000 in credit card debt. This is one three cards (Three cards total, one with 9K and two with 5k each). These cards are closer to 25%-28% interest rate.

Personal Loan: Took out a personal loan in 2021 after making a decision to pay off credit card debt post college. Currently have $10,500 @ 15% interest left to pay.

Business Debt: Started an online business end of 2022 and it did not stick after a few positive months, and have accrued $3,500 in business card debt with no current income from the business, net neutral month over month last year or so. Not profitable currently and has taken the back burner as I establish myself at my newer job. 17-24% interest.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Mortgage co. bills monthly for property tax AND state bills me for same?,"This is somewhat convoluted, so I'll try to be especially clear.

I inherited a home with a mortgage that I took over and am close to paying off. It's a fixed rate loan on a home in California. Normally I receive a refund each year for overpayment, but when that didn't arrive by September and I noticed a slight increase in the bill, I went looking.

In reviewing documents from the mortgage company (Chase), I noticed that their itemized monthly bill includes a $500+ charge for the property tax. I did some math, and over a 12 month period, it works out to be exactly the same amount the state tax bills me for the same property each year.

Does this mean I'm paying property taxes twice -- in essence, being unnecessarily double billed? Both have always requested payment in full and never indicated that the state is getting anything from my mortgage company in property taxes.

I'm not the most financially savvy to begin with, and that's been compounded by neuro damage, so I'm having a hard time sussing out what I'm looking at. Any guidance would be appreciated.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,What to do with old roth IRA and next steps/personal feelings about ethically investing,"Hello! As the title says I (F26) am in need of some advice with financial planning. I work a job that pays about $46,000 pre tax (about 34,740 post tax) per year in a fairly LOC location in the US, and live with my mom as I take care of her and help her with transportation. Feel free to skip to the last two paragraphs as it’s what I’m actually stuck with, but I figured it may be helpful to provide a mini financial audit for background. I have a love for run on sentences and long paragraphs so there is a TLDR at the end!

Monthly Expenses

Food- a little less than $400 a month for 2 people

Gas – I budget for $65 a month, it’s usually around 45-60

Eating out, misc- about 180-200 a month

Bills- phone plan, car insurance, property taxes, utilities, they come out to maybe 590-617 a month.

Dental and medical insurance is through my job, all together it’s $26 a month

My car was paid off in cash, and my mom refuses to let me pay anything for housing other than utilities and taxes.

Assets

I have about 30k I put down to buy our house, we bought it from our landlord/family friend at no interest rate, we settled on 160k I think Zillow has it around 220k now although I do think that in the coming years we’ll need to fix a lot of things.

An emergency savings account which also includes categories for auto expenses, travel, and possible future schooling funds in a credit union, parts of this is in a CD ladder (one at 5.006%, the other at 4.9%), and parts are in a checking account at my credit union that has an APY of 4%. In total, all of this is about 45k. Might add another CD to this depending on what folks advise.

I have an FSA through my job for $250 a year, mostly just for OTC stuff, sunscreen, dental cleanings, etc.

I also have about 8k in a state pension, it is employee matched but I’m not yet vested, it’s still another 4 years to become vested or if I turn 65.

I have about 1k in Acorns, I set this up a couple years ago in college when it was only $1 each month, but lately I’ve been wondering if it’s worth paying $30 a year for it but it helps me to passively invest.

Lastly, and the reason I’m making this post, I have an old roth 401k from an internship years ago, I totally forgot about it and 3 years ago tried to log in to the company it was rolled over into (Inspira Financial- used to be Millenium Trust Company, see google reviews for my hesitancy to stay with them) and while waiting for a response to help me log in, it again slipped my mind. It had about $600+ but after finally remembering about it, I was able to finally log in this week and after fees ( I think?) it’s now about $480.

Logically, I think at this point I should set up another roth IRA and just rollover the aforementioned IRA into another account that I have a bit more trust in for the tax benefits and starting young. At the same time, I’m pretty hesitant about putting money into retirement accounts that I can’t pull money from easily. I grew up not that wealthy and I suspect that as my mom gets older she’ll have more medical costs, so there’s something in me that wants to keep money as liquid as I can. I am a bit risk averse and frankly not sure about the ethics of investing in the market (not here to argue about that as I know it’s nuanced, just explaining!). A part of me just wants to pull the money out of the old roth ira out and put it in a CD or hysa (my banking direct?) and just take the fees and tax but I also know that might be dumb and maybe I should just keep it where it is (I did read the flowchart that confirms it’s dumb, but, if I understand it correctly, the fees I’d pay for cashing out vs rolling it over into another ira has a difference of about $85 since I’m still in a lower tax bracket and it’s not a huge amount?) . I guess I just need someone to look this over and either smack my head and call me an idiot or some advice about what they recommend for next steps. I’m setting up an appointment with the investment team at my local credit union soon but figured it couldn’t hurt to see what the internet thinks about my financial choices, much appreciated!

TLDR: Trying to figure out what to do with an old roth IRA with high fees that was rolled over from an internship, and if you have any advice for people who are wary about “ethically investing”, whatever that means, would appreciate that also.",2024-07-05 19:27:13,2.0,9.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,TurboTax initially mishandled foreign tax credit for me this year. I would not recommend its use and had a much better experience with lower cost software,"I have a simple enough tax situation, and tried TurboTax due to a colleague's endorsement of its ability to reconcile cost basis info. I was deeply unimpressed, and also saw it catastrophically mishandle the foreign tax credit.

My tax situation

* W2
* dividends including significant foreign income
* a requirement to file form 1116
* minor interest income
* RSUs I sell immediately
* backdoor/mega roth conversions
* minor tax loss harvesting between near equivalent ETFs

TurboTax - for the form fetching and filling had minor pros

* handled the tax loss harvesting 1099-B's perfectly (auto-imported; I had to manually enter these for FreeTaxUSA)
* did not handle importing the correct cost basis for RSUs, though reconciling was more interactive than with FreeTaxUSA
* messed up some of the 1099-div imports (checked FACTA box when it wasn't checked), but easily fixed / saved time vs FreeTaxUSA. Though the fact that its importing functionality isn't 100% makes it much less useful.

What really surprised me was it proceeded to go ***way*** off the rails from 1099-div income

* it brought up some internal interface in a microscopic region that wouldn't proceed until I checked a box to credit foreign tax paid without reconciliation via 1116
* after that, it correctly did not directly credit ***all*** foreign tax paid which is not permissible for my situation, but it did not credit ***any*** foreign tax paid, which is wrong in the other direction. At the ""review"" step it didn't flag that it was leaving thousands of dollars in credit unclaimed
* going back to the deductions section, and going through the interview for foreign tax credit the 1st time, it asked if I worked in a foreign country and after saying no told me I don't qualify for any credit, which was clearly wrong. I had already reported foreign income and tax!
* going through the interview again it noted I already reported foreign income and tax and worked the 2nd time

I was honestly surprised at how bad the TurboTax experience was. If I didn't already know what my tax situation was its interview format would have arrived at a clearly incorrect tax bill that was too high.

It's not worth 10$, and certainly not worth the outrageous ***178$*** they wanted. Free software (I do pay 15$ for my NY/NYC taxes) worked ***drastically*** better for me.

I do still have a philosophical opposition to having to pay money to a 3rd party software firm to pay my taxes, but not to the point I'm filling out a paper return for NY. If anyone knows of truly free options for NY/NYC taxes irrespective of income I'd be interested!",2024-04-14 20:12:40,0.0,7.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Able to save but are my goals unreachable?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been very fortunate so far and put myself in a decent position.

I’m 33, married, no kids. My take home after taxes is about 10K a month. I’m putting into retirement (not a lot, really the minimum) and I have a liquid 4 month emergency fund. No CC debt. No loans. If I need to I can push to save $2500 a month but I’m consistently saving 2K per month. 

We don’t take vacations, don’t overspend and adhere to our budget very strictly (edit: perhaps not strictly enough). That extra $500 generally we save and earmark for big purchases for QOL items (new air conditioner, etc.). I also have an extra cushion and built in contingencies where if I need to I can liquidate absolutely everything and have about 50k close to near immediately. Comfortably with no big changes I have about 20K liquid on hand. 

I live in an extremely high cost of living area (top 3). The issue is I want to buy a house at some point because I’m sick of renting and pissing money away and was originally saving for that but the average house in my city costs around 1 million. The lowest house in an area where it’s still safe is 750k - 850k. We could move to a nearby area that’s farther but the houses there are still 600k-650k and I would have to use my car to commute and pay tolls every day.

I guess my bottom line question is, what is the move? Do I just keep slowly saving for a down payment? Should I abandon that idea and pump everything into retirement accounts? COOPs in my area are about 400-600k and I can do the mortgage on those pretty easy but the HOA fees are going to crush my saving potential down to about $600 a month. The other thing is that it doesn’t solve the down payment question. 

It sucks because at this point it looks like I’m literally stuck until I get an inheritance which seems really fucked up and morbid and won’t happen for a long time (hopefully, we both have extremely good relationships with our parents).  But I really don’t know where to go from here. 

The other thing is that my job is very region specific. If I pick up and go to a lower cost of living area my income is going to drop significantly with the same type of job. My wife’s also but to a lesser extent. My estimate for moving to a lower COL are would put our monthly take home at around 6k - 7k a month. 

Any advice so I’m not just “saving to save?”

Edit: After a review and some math, my fixed expenses come out to about 6300 a month which leaves us about 3800 a month. From there I take the 2k for savings, then household expenses, etc and the rest I let stay and build in the checking account which currently has a little more of a months worth of an additional emergency fund.

Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,Roth 401(k) Accidentally Rolled into Traditional Rollover IRA,"     Apologies for the length, just really stuck and wanted to include the relevant info. Back in February of 2023, I rolled over $20,000 from a previous company's Roth 401(k) into a Traditional Rollover IRA with Fidelity. This should not have been possible - transferring between different types of tax advantaged accounts like this is illegal. However, at the time, I was not aware that the rollover IRA was traditional (silly, I know), there were no controls to prevent it, and I only just realized when I started doing my taxes this year. In the time the money has been in the account, it has accrued an additional ~$1000 of earnings.

     After contacting Fidelity several times, each person gave me different instructions. They were, in order:
     1.   Complete an IRA recharacterization form. However, that does not apply to a rollover contribution like this, so it wouldn't process. So I called Fidelity again.
     2.   Perform a roth conversion, but that is not possible because the initial rollover was illegal since it went from Roth to traditional. So they transferred me to a new rep
     3.   The new rep told me to contact a tax accountant and do as they instruct. After calling a tax accountant I was informed that this should be able to be fixed by Fidelity since my 2023 taxes have not yet been submitted. So I called Fidelity again
     4.   This time, Fidelity said that due to the rollover happening ~1 year ago, the only thing that could be done is to complete a Return of Excess, have the funds sent back to me, then complete a Certification for Late Rollover Contribution. This would create a taxable event that would need to be reported on my 2024 taxes

     After reviewing the return of excess form, it didn't really seem to be appropriate for my situation since it's not really an excess contribution.  Additionally, I don't know what the actual financial implications of this being a taxable event are, so I don't know what to expect. I know its my fault for making this mistake, but I have no idea what the right way to fix it is and could use some help.",2024-02-26 22:28:20,0.0,3.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,TaxFix Deutschland,"(CAN) Ontario. Bipolar/ADHD, horrible at life and taxes. I'm a decade behind. How do I just pay someone to do it for me?","Yes, I already posted this to the Personal Finance Canada subreddit, but I'm submitting it here too for visibility. Please just ignore if you can't answer about Canadian taxes.

----

I haven't done my taxes in something like 8-10 years. ***Please be kind.*** I know I should have kept on top of this stuff, but I'm not mentally well (more on this at the end).

Facts here:

---

I'm low income, so I don't expect to owe the government. In fact, I've probably lost out on some tax credits or rebates (like the grocery rebate).

I just want to get it done. 

I don't know how to get started. I tried logging into My Service Canada and that was a PROCESS because my ID had an error on it which caused the system to think that I was not the person my SIN number corresponded to. Once I got my ID fixed, I was able to log in, but it had NO information about my T4s and it just keeps giving me an error message. 

I contacted the CRA about it, but they said they couldn't move forward with me. The lady on the phone said that I'd have to send a letter to some PO box for the CRA (wrote it down somewhere but I forget the exact details), explaining the situation and asking them to provide me information about which years I still have to file and ask for T4s to be mailed to me. I thought this might be a little unusual, but I checked my credit report through my bank just in case, and there's nothing unusual ... I think it's some kind of glitch or perhaps caused because it's just been THAT LONG since I did my taxes last. In fact, I've actually never done any kind of taxes for myself. My mom did them for me until she died when I was 20 or so.

This is honestly kind of overwhelming. I just want to pay someone to get it done for me, to catch me up, so it's not something weighing on my mind, you know? Hopefully I'll be entitled to some tax refunds which will help to offset the costs of paying someone to get this done. 

My taxes will probably involve the following:

- T4s from over 10 employers (I've job hopped a lot) *(can't find the T4s)*

- I've applied for and received payments from OSAP a few times, and I've had tuition related expenses *(can't find documentation)*

- I've had to pay for some certifications for work several times *(I have these receipts)*

- I've had some out of pocket medical expenses that I may be eligible to submit *(I have these receipts)*

- Is it true that there's some kind of rent tax benefit or something? Someone mentioned that to me once - I'm definitely a renter and low income... do I submit receipts for that for some minor tax break or something? *(I have these receipts going back 10 years, never claimed them). 

- I qualified for EI this year starting from July and it ends in February. I've had a part time job while I collected reduced payments. *(I don't have the documentation of this yet, but I'm sure I'll be mailed something)*

- During covid I accumulated some credit card debt because I was unemployed for almost 2 years. Didn't qualify for CERB since I was a student. I've heard you can claim for credit card debt? *(I have some bills to verify, I'm sure the call to my CC company is straightforward)*

- I did collect the student version of CERB in the summer of 2020, but I was only eligible for half payments for something like 3 or 4 months. *(can't find documentation)*

- I have 72 cents in a TFSA. I might have moved around up to $3,000 - $6,000 around several years ago which I used to pay for school either within that year or the year after. *(I think I can get this info from my bank)*

These are the most complicated claims that might reduce my taxable income (if they're valid). 

I don't operate a business, I'm not self-employed. I haven't been married, I have no kids or dependents, I'm not a senior and I don't have a disability (yet). 

I am also interested in applying for the Disability Tax Credit, but only after I've caught up on my taxes. My psychologist recommended it after reviewing my employment history. I am undergoing an extensive psychological assessment for severe bipolar disorder and severe ADHD, both of which have been undiagnosed until recently (I'm 32). The testing is going to take place over the course of several months, and I'd love to have completed all my taxes by then, so that the psychologist can fill out the documentation for a mental disability. BTW, the severe ADHD and bipolar are why I've been so disorganized, unable to complete my education, and had frequent job losses. 

**So here are my questions:**

- What kind of tax professional should I be looking for? 

- How do I verify that they're charging me a fair price and they're not some kind of scam artist? I don't want to hand out my tax info to just any random person who says they do bookkeeping for example. 

- Do you have any specific suggestions for businesses that help with individual taxes like this? 

I'm in Toronto. I don't mind over-paying a *little bit* if I know they're legitimate, thorough, and actually convenient. This has been in the back of my mind making me feel guilty for years, and being on medication for the first time in my life is giving me some stability and follow through. I recently qualified for EI for the first time after a job loss in my entire life, it's allowed me to save a little bit of money. Getting properly medicated was my first priority, and now it's figuring out my taxes. Someone in a similar position to me (like almost identical income and stuff) ended up getting $35,000 back in taxes because she was so low income and hadn't claimed in so long. Even if I get half of that, that could be life changing because I could finish school (I'm ONE CREDIT AWAY).

Anyway, any tips on this would be appreciated.",2023-12-18 19:12:33,0.0,7.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,MyExpatTaxes,You know you're a US taxpayer when....your 1040 return is 132 pages long,"I'm a fairly financially literate person. I got an A in my high school accounting class. I run a business. And when my CPA sends me a draft of my 1040 each year I have always reviewed it in detail and tried to understand it and catch any errors. But I'm afraid that won't be possible this year, as I just received it and discovered it to be 132 pages long.

This page count covers only my 1040 and related schedules and attachments such as schedule E, basis calculations, FBAR, AMT, etc. It does not include my business tax return or any state tax return. I am not a billionaire, a day-trader, or a real estate mogul with dozens of properties. I just own a single rental property and two small businesses. And I'm an expat. I'm shocked at how much more complicated the tax regulations get every year. I remember when my return was a mere 35 pages. But then it grew to 55, and then 80. I just barely managed to review that return. It took hours.

What should I do? There's no way I can possibly review this return in any meaningful level of detail. Should I just blindly trust my CPA and hope for the best?",2024-03-24 15:18:07,0.0,19.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,I used to work at Optima Tax Relief. Here is the inside scoop.,"On a regular basis I see threads asking if Optima Tax Relief (OTR) is a scam or if they can actually reduce your tax debt. These threads usually die after 3 or 4 posts with no real insight or knowledge provided. Let this thread serve as the definitive go-to guide for all OTR questions. Most tax resolution companies use the same business model as far as I'm aware but I only have personal experience with OTR. I will check in over the weeks to answer questions if the thread gains traction. I want this to be a more long-term thread. Please upvote for visibility and to help with SEO. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

You've probably heard OTR's ads on the radio or found them via an internet search. When you first call in, you will be put in touch with a sales person (called a ""Tax Associate"" on the inside). This sales person has no real tax knowledge. They probably couldn't fill out a TurboTax return if they tried. Their sole responsibility is to close the sale and extract money from you. They will be vague about details and timeframes. They will promise you the sun, moon and stars to get you to sign up. Check out the infamous sales call scene from [the Boiler Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY4UVrXzyhE) to get an idea. Except OTR's salespeople aren't wearing suits. Hoodies and basketballs shorts are more their style. The dress code in the entire company is sloppy. I've seen employees come to work in pajama bottoms and slippers. I'm not joking.

Phase 1 after sign-up is the ""investigation phase"" which takes around 30 days and usually costs $295. I've seen the investigation fee drop to as low as $99 so you can try haggling. This phase involves you signing an [8821 form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8821.pdf) to allow a minimum wage idiot to order your account transcripts from IRS.gov. But wait - can't I do that myself for free at [IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript)? Yes, you can and it takes less than 5 mins. This will become a common theme, as you will see. However, OTR will not waive the fee even if you provide your own transcripts. You must pay up and allow the company to order them because..uh, just because ok. 

After all transcripts have been ordered and 30 sleepless night for you, OTR will have an idea of how much total tax debt you're in including penalties and interest. This is when the salespeople pitch phase 2 - ""the resolution"". They will likely ask for copies of your recent paystubs at this time to get an idea of how much you earn. The most common question I see in threads about OTR is how much they charge for their services. Truth is the more you make, the more they charge. I have seen resolution fees anywhere from $2,000 to $40,000+. It gets insane. If you pushback, they may lower their fee a little. They will also lower the fee if you pay up front rather than installments. But they know you're stressed out, desperate and scared of the IRS. They will play on your fears. Many customers drop out at this stage when faced with a huge resolution fee but others think ""I've already paid them $295 for the investigation. I can't stop now"". Sunk cost fallacy.

Once you've signed up for resolution, it's time to get you into compliance i.e. making sure you're up to date with your tax return filings for the past 6 years. Inexperienced tax preparers, who took a 2 week crash course, will be tasked with using your wage and income transcripts obtained from the IRS to prepare any unfiled years. If your tax situation is in any way complex, you're out of luck. These tax preparers are little more than data entry monkeys. In fact, much of the tax prep is offshored to the Philippines and Vietnam. Third worlders half-way across the planet having access to your sensitive financial info including your SSN and the SSNs of your kids - what could go wrong? If you call in to speak with a member of the tax prep staff, the first thing you will notice is the foreign accents. That's if you can get a hold of them. A common complaint in online reviews is that nobody ever answers the phone. Usually because the staff have heavy case loads and are under pressure to churn out as many returns as possible. They will also harass you about providing records for medical and business expenses if you're self-employed so I hope you kept that Home Depot receipt from 2019. You can skip this step by getting your tax returns prepared outside OTR but you're still paying for the service either way. You will continue to receive threatening letters from the IRS while this is happening and possibly wage garnishment. OTR is powerless to stop this despite their promises to the contrary. Only entering a resolution can stop the letters.

When all tax returns have been filed, we will finally know how much you owe the IRS in total. Now it's time to route you into one of three resolution options: 

1. Offer in Compromise (OIC) sometimes referred to as the ""fresh start program"" which is the only genuine option for reducing your tax debt. Very few people will qualify for this. You can check for yourself using the [IRS pre qualifier tool](https://irs.treasury.gov/oic_pre_qualifier/) for free. There you go, I saved you $20,000 and a year of headaches. Even if you do qualify, you can submit the paperwork yourself. Form 656 and 433-A.

2. Currently Non Collectible status. A lien will be placed on your home and you will not see a tax refund for 10 years. You're playing a waiting game for your tax debt to expire. There is a 10 year statute of limitations for the IRS to collect the debt. You can also apply for this yourself for free over the phone. Be sure to fill out 433-F before calling the IRS.

3. Payment plan. You can set this up yourself for free at https://www.irs.gov/payments/online-payment-agreement-application. This is what most people get. You will wonder why did I pay OTR $10,000 when I could have put that money towards my IRS bill? In fact you will be worse off as thousands of dollars of penalties and interest will have accrued in the year you have spent waiting for OTR to finalize your case.

The most common customers were the poor, elderly and ethnic minorities. I don't know how the owners sleep at night ripping off the most vulnerable in our society. I have had disabled veterans break down crying on the phone with me. Single mothers who were one paycheck away from homelessness begging me to make her tax debt go away. Don't get mad at the low level employee at OTR. They are often as poor and desperate as the customers. Check the job sites online. Mailroom monkey starts at $16 an hour in high cost of living California. And they are always hiring as the staff turnover is crazy. The company is not staffed with tax attorneys with degrees from Harvard. It's staffed with salespeople, marketing people and shysters - most of whom never set foot inside a college.

Reddit,Accountable,Tax accountant told us we wouldn’t suffer a penalty by waiting to pay taxes until after 2024 filing deadline. We just got hit with a $20k penalty plus interest from the state of MA anyway.,"Hi folks. Me (31F) and my husband (45M) filed jointly for the first time. He makes a significant amount more than I do and had a particularly confusing tax year (exited a company = capital gains tax on profit units). We hired an accountant after he told us he wouldn’t need to file an extension. He did end up having to do so anyway, but he advised us to hold off paying any estimated tax until we had the K-1 and knew exactly what to pay. My husband asked if we would be hit with a penalty by not paying and asked why we wouldn’t just pay estimated taxes anyway. Our accountant said not to worry, we wouldn’t get hit with a penalty and just hold off until the K-1 was finalized/sent over by the folks at his previous company. It was finalized mid-October and we submitted immediately. We now just received a letter from the state of MA indicating that we need to pay a penalty and interest to the tune of $20k+. We’re both concerned about this, and also what it means for penalties we might owe on the federal level. We hired him because this was a particularly confusing tax year and it appears to us that he actually made things worse with communicating incorrect information and dissuading us multiple times from paying ahead of time.

I feel like we have been given bad counsel here. He had made several errors along the way which pointed to him being incompetent: he took days to response to queries, frequently sent documents to my email address despite being asked to always cc my husband (I’m on maternity leave), etc. I don’t know the best way to proceed here when it comes to handling—he’s sent along an invoice for his work but we don’t feel like we should pay him or these penalties +interest, but we don’t know the best way to manage this (do we sue him? Apply for abatement? If so, on what grounds?). Any advice would be appreciated.

TIA!

TL;DR: tax accountant told us not to pay estimated tax prior to filing deadline because we wouldn’t be penalized, we were penalized (\~20k in-state only, federal TBD), and we’re not sure what we can/should do next to avoid paying what we shouldn’t have to.

Update: we knew exactly what was on the K-1 because the profit shares were already paid out and we shared this with our accountant prior to hiring him. Our accountant is not a CPA. He got back to us moments ago and he said he didn't remember we told him (or knew) exactly what the number was, which is why he recommended we don't pay estimated. We do have email evidence that we shared this, so this is the accountant's mistake. Advice on proceeding?

Reddit,Accountable,IRS or Tax Court?,"Question:  Should I continue working directly with the IRS or petition the Tax Court?

Story:  I received a CP3219A notice on August 12, allowing me to petition the Tax Court until November 12. I’ve been communicating with the IRS to resolve my issue, but they can't review my recent information until November 25.

The problem stems from my BlockFi account, where they incorrectly reported my cryptocurrency sale as a 100% gain. I invested my own money in a stablecoin, resulting in no gain besides the monthly dividends. BlockFi claimed I made $17.6k and owed $3.8k in taxes, but my actual gain was only $432.  I originally reported a gain of $346 on a 1099-MISC. I sent the IRS the corrected 1040 Schedule D and 8949 forms along with the original 1099-MISC.

NOTE:  I’ve not made any payment yet as I’m not sure what the exact amount (if any) that I’ll owe when this is finished.

There’s no CPAs, (probably my first mistake) but the 3 people who work there are all enrolled agents. They’re primarily a wealth management firm, but do taxes as well so their clients can keep everything in house.

We recently received a letter from the IRS regarding our 2022 taxes, that they found some discrepancies and that we owe them almost $7,000. When I contacted my tax company to review everything, thinking the IRS must have screwed up, they found a mistake that they admitted was their fault. 

We had 3 W-2s that year, one from my previous job for about the first half of the year, one from my current job, and my wife’s W-2. What happened I guess, is when they input everything into their system, they forgot to check a single box, designating my wife’s W-2 as hers, so all 3 W-2s were essentially assigned to me. This made it look like I paid well over the maximum allotted amount of social security tax, and the difference was added as a tax credit. We ended up getting a decent refund of course, which I didn’t think was overly suspect, as we typically had sizable refunds and just had a baby that year, so I expected it to be larger than usual. 

In reality, had the W-2s been assigned correctly, we would’ve had a much smaller refund. My tax preparer said basically, “oops, yeah that was our fault, sorry, I’d be pissed too if I were you, and wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t use us again in the future. Best I can do is refund the money you paid for filing that year ($350) and you have to pay the $7,000 to the IRS.” 

Is there any recourse here to recoup the amount of money we now owe the IRS because of what seems like a blatantly simple error made by our tax preparer? I’m in Michigan, if that makes a difference. 

I know of course, I should review my taxes before filing, and I did, but I’m not a money/accounting guy, I’m in medicine. I glanced over everything, but don’t know what the hell I’m looking at most of the time, so unless they would’ve said our refund was like $20,000, I don’t know if I’d ever question anything. That’s why I hire what’s supposed to be a professional. 

TL;DR- my tax person accidentally assigned all 3 of our W-2s in 2022 to me, giving us a large tax credit for seemingly overpaying social security tax that year, and now the IRS says I owe them $7,000 and my tax people are refusing to help me out despite admitting it’s their simple mistake.

Reddit,Accountable,Question about tax revision by my CPA from 2020/2021 large refund - seems sketchy,"Hello all,

I read the rules and I’m just looking for opinions here. I’m concerned my accountant I have used for 2 years, but never met in person, is doing something sketchy or illegal with my taxes. I am located in Texas. 

She came to me offering to do revisions to 2020/2021 taxes as there was a lot of unclaimed refunds she said during the COVID years. She reviewed our refunds and noted we could get back close to $29k- no small chunk of change. I paid her invoice of $1800 and she did the work and send me the revisions. For 2021, she added around $9000 of claims like advertising, phone business costs, and car costs. I asked her where she got these numbers from as I did not want to sign my name to it, and had not documented those, and did not discuss it with her- she replied “All averages allowed during Covid working from home ..free money to most. “ then another message “Trust me I have everything needed I been doing this for 30 years and these were the only years allowed “. I said ok sounds good, and confirmed that only my husband worked from home these years, so that would be for him and not me, and I have not heard back. It is the weekend, she may reply tomorrow, but she also had texted me Saturday morning and did not respond after my second clarifying message. I personally feel I should be able to politely ask a question and for clarification about MY taxes after paying $1800 for an afternoon of work and should get an answer. This initial response, then the lack of response does not sit well with me. I subscribe to the if it seems too good to be true it often is, line of thought too, so it just feels off. 

Does this sound correct to anyone? I’m very concerned I spent $1800 and don’t even want to file this now. I can’t find anything about this online at all so this is why I’ve come to this subreddit. 

For 2 years, I have had no issues with her, she was recommended by a friend at work who used her and parents used her for some time, and at the time I could find more about her online. Now I only see 1 review from this year saying she deposited her refund money into her own account instead of the return going to the client- this is just an aside, I am unsure if there is any truth to this, but it did add to my unease in the situation given I am not finding much more about her. Could she have been punished and that’s why I’m finding less about her online business? Unsure. 

Thanks in advance. ",2024-09-08 18:53:36,4.0,33.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,H&R Block charged me $575 and still didn’t understand the original issue,"I’ve been married for five years and we have always filed our taxes separately. We also make sacrifices to save extra money and put it into Roth IRA accounts each year. In March, thanks to trying to file with FreeTaxUSA for the first time, I discovered that if you are married filing separately, you can’t contribute to an IRA if you make more than $10000 a year. 


In five years of being married, between my former tax guy, the H&R Block tax preparation website and FreeTaxUSA, only the latter ever made this information known. Over the course of five years, we filed separately and thought we were doing everything just fine and no one ever said otherwise. 


In March/April 2024, the site to download my main job’s W2 got hacked for weeks and I had to file for an extension. I got an extension until October. We spent some time trying to figure out how to approach this issue and decided to see a professional in person. 


In September, we went to a physical H&R location to get my taxes filed but also get the former returns amended as “married filing jointly”. The guy that was there that Saturday named Alan seemed like he knew exactly what we were talking about and seemed really calm about it. We made an appointment with him to get the issues resolved. 


At the scheduled appointment we handed over our information and explained the situation. We discovered he didn’t understand the rule about Roth IRA contributions. A few days later, he sent an email saying it wouldn’t make sense to do any amendments and still didn’t seem to get the reasoning of why we wanted to amend. Either way, I knew I was running out of time until the October 15 deadline and he had all our documents so I let him just do my normal taxes.


Today, I went in to wrap things up. He started to review all of the deductions and everything. He didn’t even remember that I had worked one day in New Jersey in 2023 which made me have an extra W2 and owe NJ $1. I had to point that out because I wanted to make sure that I didn’t owe anyone anything. 


When everything was explained he said they were charging me $575. Mind you I don’t make a ton of money. But because of the different 1099s and W2’s I had from investments and a few side gigs, that’s what they charged me. I explained that when I did my taxes the last two years with the H&R site and opted for a professional to review them, I was charged about $200 each time. He said “well this time you had someone do your taxes for you.” 
Since it is October 12 I just bit the bullet and let them charge me $575 for something I could’ve done by myself for $200. I wound up getting a return of $200, owing $300 and being charged $575… He still didn’t even solve the main issue that I was looking to solve in the first place. It feels frustrating and I’m still worried about the original issue.

Reddit,Accountable,When to Issue 1099 to Vendor,"Hello Tax Everyone,

Thank you in advance your taking the time to answer this question.

I've worked in accounting for over 15 years and have been in charge of issuing 1099s for at least 10 of those years. I recently joined a smaller organization who has an accounts payable manager that is responsible for new vendor set-up and issuing 1099s. In my role as the controller (I'm not a CPA) I was reviewing some work they had done, and I noticed they did not mark a few vendors as ""1099 eligible."" I brought it up to them just thinking it was a mistake but it ended up turning into a conversation about when to Issue 1099s that made it's way to the owner. The owner seems to trust the Accounts Payable manger who has worked for them for over 20 years. Me -I'm new, less than 6 months. I'm planning to ask our accounting firm whom files our end of year taxes when I meet with them in late December/early Jan for clarification. In the mean-time, I just wanted to get this off my chest and see what everyone else has to say.

I just want to say - I could be completely wrong. But in my experience I have always issued 1099s or 1099 MISC to any vendor or person we paid, based on how they classified themselves on their provided W-9. Regardless of what we are paying them for (rents, royalties, contractor, etc). I let the W-9 tell me what to do. If any vendor or anyone that receives a payment through AP, and they turn in a W-9 that is marked as:

Individual/Sole Proprietor  
Partnership  
Trust/Estate

OR an LLC classified as a Partnership, like in the example below.

I would issue them a 1099.

[Example W-9 Form](https://preview.redd.it/zl9zq6vxqv1e1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bf9f8a7e864b36535d41d5d74e8a211baf451d)

Anyone else agree with me? Or have I been doing this wrong for 15 years?

Thanks again for your help!

  
UPDATE:

Thank you all for your comments and such! I love the little discussion we started. Also, thank you for confirming what I was thinking. Yesterday, I was feeling just kind of frustrated about the whole thing and I just need to vent, so thanks for being there. 

I just feel passionately about this topic because I once worked for a company, and within the first few months of being there we got audited by the IRS because the person wasn't doing 1099s or vendor set-up correctly. That person would change TIN #s in the vendor record as the vendor changed names - not realizing that it should be a completely separate vendor. Was using the disregard name on the 1099 instead of the legal name, etc. It was kind of a mess and expensive! 

I just recently joined this organization mostly because the told me they weren't doing things correctly and wanted to change. But the longer I'm here I'm starting to see maybe they don't REALLY want to change. LoL. The owner did come over to my side of things, but only AFTER speaking to her friend who is a CPA. Just the common theme at this new company is you hired me because you believed I have all the skills and knowledge, but don't trust me. 

  
I'm making it sound worse than it really is - over-all I'm very happy, and not going anywhere. But there are some kinks to work out.

I am a US resident alien since January 1st 2024. As I was reviewing my accounts and thinking about how to invest my money, I discovered PFICs.

I'd like to know what to do now to limit as maximum as possible the tax headache and costs for the tax year 2024 in 2025.

Here is the situation

I hold 4.7k euros worth of the ETF Amundi MSCI World CW8 in a French Brokerage account.

This is the only ETF I have

2.5k euros of it were acquired in Summer 2023. 1.5k in April 2024. So the unrealized capital gain is about 700 euros.

What should I do right now, on top of reaching out to an expert?

- How bad will it be with the form 8621 next year?
- Should I sell all of it now?
- How to do the MtM elections - I understand it's the best thing to do
- Is there anything to do with the IRS right now? I already filed my taxes for the year 2023 for which I was a non resident alien.
- Are reinvested dividends considered distribution ? (It's a synthetic etf reinvesting the dividends)

- I also hold 1.3k of stock of a publicly traded industrial company (non PFIC) - should I liquidate it too? I saw that stocks are much easier to report

Are we supposed to be manually calculating our taxes and adding it as additional withholding? Is it because we're filing jointly? If we filed separately would that fix the issue?

ETA: Solved! I think issue is that we did not have the multiple jobs section checked off on our W4s to account for us both working. Will also review the withholding calculator on the website to make sure filing together is better for us.

Reddit,Accountable,How to correct mistake from 2018 amended returns?,"Hi all - In reviewing old returns, I noticed that in my 2018 amended return, my accountant included a schedule 1 IRA deduction for $5,500 with language ""amending return to include a 2018 deductible Traditional IRA
contribution inadvertently omitted from the original filed return"". The problem? That year I actually contributed to my Roth IRA as my AGI was below the Roth limit (but also above the limit for deductible tIRA contributions). As a result of the amended return, I received a federal and state refund. 

What do I do? It's been a number of years since the return, and I only realized today. 

Additional details: 

The amendment was primarily to take care of excess 2017 Roth contributions, so I filed Form 5329 and paid the 6% tax (I noticed the 2017 mixup in 2019, so the grace period had passed).

Reddit,Accountable,"Does a basis apply to a net Section 1231 gain from am LLC, if shares were inherited? ","I received my 2023 K-1 from a real estate partnership. I inherited a share in this partnership from my father who passed away in January 2021. A FMV of his share was given at the time of his death. Due to other issues with my father’s estate, the share in this partnership was not transferred to myself until March 2023. The 2023 K-1 I received has a net section gain of $41,011 in Box 10. It also has rental income of $1960. 

I found it odd there was no step up basis for the 1231 gain, since the property was sold in 2023, and I only was transferred ownership of his share in March 2023. So, upon checking with the LLC’s CPA’s they did state Section 754 election was in place and didn’t know anything about this transfer and valuation upon my father’s death. After giving them this info, they informed me to adjust my rental income by section 754 depreciation of $5472. But, when I asked again about the 1231 gain and a step-up basis they gave no info. (They also had refused to amend the k-1.)

My brother’s accountant (he received the same equal share in the LLC as I did) is adamant that the net 1231 gain should be $0, cuz our basis would be $42,011 since the property could not have appreciated that much from transfer of ownership of shares to sale of property. 

 I’m not sure who is right and what to do in this case. They won’t amend the k-1, but is there a way to report a basis to bring down the 1231 gain to $0? Or does section 754 not apply to 1231 gains? 

The way the partnership CPA’s are speaking to me, they seem to be saying it’d only apply to the passive rental income over the next 27.5 years. 

Any advice or info is appreciated.

In short, should a basis apply to a 1231 gain on an inherited share of a real estate LLC? And if so, should it be on the K-1 or is it just entered on your return? And if so, where or how?

I am in California. Just over two months ago my wife and I were considering buying a Used 2017 Chevy Volt from a Chevrolet dealership. We got decently way into the contract (after they confirmed we were eligible for the Used EV Tax Credit) but we ultimately walked away from the deal due to them pushing extras we didn't want. 

A few days ago we tried to purchase a used Kia Niro Plug-In but when the Kia dealership submitted the information/application for the Used EV Tax Credit for this vehicle into their IRS portal, it came back as 'under review' due to a previous claim made from the Chevrolet Dealer. 

I contacted the Chevrolet dealership and after some frustrating back-and-forth they did ultimately ""void"" the transaction. I talked to someone at the IRS who suggested that I asked the Kia dealership to email an IRS account to explain the situation to hopefully resolve it (and sooner) but they're not particularly keen on doing anything. 

Not sure what recourse, if any, I have against the Chevrolet dealership as I now have to wait until the review is complete (estimated for two weeks) before Kia will let me take possession of the car. IRS did suggest that what the Chevrolet dealership did was ""unlawful"" but not sure if it is worth complaining/if there is even a remedy available.

I’ve reviewed the spousal beneficiary rules on the IRS website and it states they may “take distributions based on their own life expectancy, or rollover the account into their own IRA”

Basically have just been waiting for my preparer to finish reviewing these last few weeks and my return is overall a pretty vanilla Schedule C, but there is one area where I am still confused.

I did a commercial solar instal that strattled 2023 and 2024. I put a down payment in Fall 2023 but utility did not turn on until January 2024 (after which I paid the remaining bill)

When I discussed this with my accountant months ago, they misheard/misunderstood me and I was told I could not claim the credit until 2024 when the system goes online. (True for residential installs)

I only recently realized that was not the case and I could have taken it this year due to the down payment and the commencement of construction.

**But at this point: I'm 100% fine with waiting til 2024 to take the credit.** would rather not add the 3468 at the 11th hour on a return since my preparer is already down to crunch time. And it would make zero difference to me if we did.

I made all of my 2023 estimated payments thinking I would not be getting the credit until 2024. I do not expect to owe anything at filing. And I have underpaid my 2024 estimated payments with the ITC in mind so, if we did for some reason file for the credit in 2023....I would just roll that credit into my 2024 estimates anyways.

So, that all seems fine! The only thing that confuses me:

How do I handle the cost that was paid towards the system in 2023? Can I take the allowed bonus/accelerated depreciation on the downpayment even though I will not be reporting the solar install and taking the ITC until my 2024 return?

Reddit,Accountable,"Hawaii Taxes are Hard, is this uncommon?","I have rather complicated tax returns. 3 different businesses, multiple properties w/ cost segregations and i'm in Hawaii which I find makes finding local accountants rather challenging. 

I have a accountant/CPA that does bookkeeping and tax filing for me and he's fantastic. But my taxes are to the point I don't really understand them and I'm hoping to find an accountant that would be willing to review my taxes for a second opinion and spend 3-4 hours explaining each item to me. My current accountant could do a sit down with me but there is a bit of a language barrier.

I understand this is a lot of time and work so i'm expecting to pay a fair amount for this but I don't even know how to go about asking another company as most accountants I speak to here locally know very little about s corp elections or cost segregation studies which makes it tough..

Reddit,Accountable,Retained earning discrepancies in tax,"I'll keep this short as I can.  I started a new position in private 2 months ago. I have 2 years in public (tax) and ran for the hill. Owner didn't have an accountant ot bookkeeper doing the books- she was an office administrator who wss helping- for 5 years. 
Owner files 2023 taxes and brings to me to review. I find three mistakes. One was where she took a 60k expense - twice! She had to amend immediately. 
Soooo I decided to go back to his inception (2018) and not only was the office administrator clearly changing things on years that taxes were filed, but the first year of his business, he has a (59k)  R/E that he is off balance by on the M2 R/E reconciliation worksheet. 
I checked 2019, 2020, 2021 hoping for book to tax ties and maybe thr R/E would shake out. Nope. 
Shes been consistently filing returns for 6 years with retained discrepancies. 
I brought all this up to her and she wants go fix it all, with my help of course. 
I told her no. It was up to her to fix mistakes she made. I was hired to do MY job, not hers and that I'm super busy with my day to day as it is. Now I feel bad- but honestly, this needs fixed. 
I can change the PL all day  everyday and agree it to net income- but that balance sheet? Wow. Missing liabilities. Assets missing that she captured to tax, assets on the bs that were actually  sold and on the return as sold, no one was ever tying book to tax (no depreciation or accumulated depreciation). I could go fix all that but AR AP AND inventory and cash balances were off as well consistently. Makes me wanna cry a bit. 

Anyone ever have a mess like this? 

Editing to say I asked her if she had journal entries that she was making each year on her end due to all the discrepancies. She said ""no. I just did the best I could with the information that I had"". Thr r/e is off balance by (283,000) as of 2023. 

Also editing to say I was not hired as a CPA. That was part of my hiring- specifically as well. No CPA services such as tax returns. Also, my 2 years in  public- in my first year I was  hired in March so I only did individual. 2nd year I did a handful of s corp. A handful enough to know I should be able to back into ordinary income from book to tax in a few seconds. (How I caught his mistake first and dove into it)  I work VERY part time (16 hrs) due to a back injury, and am paid at even below a bookkeeper rate. I'm ok with that. One back surgery  in and headed to another.

Reddit,Accountable,Gig worker solutions/ anchor financial ,"I initially started this process with Gig Worker Solutions and Anchor Financial of filing an IRS amendment for an SETC and filed on with the IRS 2/12/24.

On May 14, Anchor claims I am due back money for the credit and stated they can advance the money due to be received minus 20% fee for filing and it takes having transcripts from the IRS to verify that there is no money owed to the IRS (in which it shows I do not) on or around May 14. I accept, they ask for 15-20 days to get them and verify then they will release the money which should be received in an additional 2 business days. 

At the end of the 20 days about June 4, it was said they still have not received the transcripts but I could provide the official transcripts on my own. I do so immediately, but then for weeks they claimed the transcripts needed to be submitted a different way to keep me on the run around for a couple weeks. 

Then there comes a point about June 17 there is no possible way to make that claim of not having the transcripts bc I submitted them multiple ways multiple times, they then inform me they have them they are under review and I should receive a text or email to verify my deposit info. 

Around July 1st or so I had not gotten the text or email I call to inquire if there is a hold up and they then tell me they supposedly needed an additional 15-20 days to review them which I was never informed about nor is not disclosed anywhere whatsoever. Nevertheless that time too is coming and going and I’m still here waiting approaching mid July and their claim is they are supposedly waiting on a 3rd party to disperse the funds and still being told to just wait it will come sometime. One would think if a 3rd party is not doing what they need to someone would be contacting them to ensure it gets done and staying on top of it until it does! Especially a company offering something within a time frame and a customer was already way out of turn around time thats claimed to be able to provide. 

Then for two weeks I tried to call Anchor and only get voicemail and no one returned my calls. July 15th would have 22 weeks of processing at the IRS. I have also spoke with the IRS May 8 when where’s my amended return changed w provided number and they stated there is no issues just are behind in processing.

As of July 17 I had finally got ahold of someone at Anchor and at first he said everything is in order I just need to be patient so I informed them I’ve been more than patient and asked that if maybe they should be contacting their third party to investigate why I haven’t received it yet or let me speak w management. Then changed his narrative to now the third party is no longer giving me my money via advance. They said that the third-party changed it that they would not be advancing anyone the money who filed before April 1 2024. The gentleman said it should be coming in two separate checks and also have interest with it supposedly. I told him I never received the email that I would not be receiving it I asked if he could look into this further for me because this was the first I heard of it and can see what’s actually going on bc in my end it still shows I’m waiting on the advance. He then said he don’t know what to tell me but I won’t be getting the advance nor will he further answer my questions or assist me because he has to abruptly get off the phone. When I asked him well who is going to help me investigate what’s going on with my account, will a manager call me back to discuss what’s going on or should I speak with to get some answers, he said he had to go again for some impromptu meeting they were having and literally hung up on me. 

I’m still waitin on my money been months at this point and Gig worker Solutions/ Anchor just keep buying time and try to make excuses! When I inquire about what’s going on, I’m usually faced with rudeness and never any factual answers of why I haven’t received my money or what is going on with my account. A supervisor finally called me back a week after I asked to speak with one then said he literally don’t know what to tell me, just be patient. There is never any urgency to address or tend to the matter even though there is a time frame they claim to be able to provide. 

I have since spoken with the BBB (in which the will not respond to), FINRA, the Virginia State Corporation Committee. 

I have also spoke with the IRS and they have told me there are no issues with my amendment they just have not processed it as of yet but I should be receiving 2 separate checks since I filed for the credit correction for 2 years because the years I filed for are being processed that way. They also informed me to make sure I sent in the power of attorney agreement for the advance with REVOKE across the top taking them off as a representative that fax number is (855) 214-7516 and also submitted a change of address form so my check would not be sent to them which is critical anyone in the same boat as me do asap!! I also check my irs portal to make sure they don’t try to resubmit anything esp the change of address form bc they had me sign numerous for some reason which I found odd.

Reddit,Accountable,H&R Block Failed to File State Taxes,"Not sure if this question is best suited for r/legaladvice or r/tax, so cross-posting to both.

**Contextual info:**

The tax year in question is 2020.

My wife and I married on March 24th, 2020. I've only ever lived and filed in Maryland. Prior to getting married, my wife lived in VA. She moved to Maryland in early March. This living arrangement was beyond my comfort level for self-filing, so we decided to make an appointment with H&R Block and have our taxes prepared and filed by a ""Tax Pro.""

**Timeline:**

On or around April 15th, 2021, we met in-person with a Tax Pro at an H&R Block office. At that meeting, the Tax Pro began initiated our returns by completing their internal forms. Additionally, we provided her with a void check for any deposits/withdrawals. While evaluating our tax scenario for VA and MD, she said she was unsure how to proceed and would need to do some research. She stated she would send us an electronic consent form to sign once the filing documents were complete.

On or around May 11, we received a notification in the H&R Block mobile app to approve the tax returns. The returns were approved electronically. As a note, this date was recently provided to us as the filing date for our Federal and VA taxes. I don't recall the specific date and the messages are no longer in our inbox within the H&R Block app.

**Recent events:**

Last week we received a letter from the Maryland Comptroller stating they did not have record of our 2020 filing. I logged into our H&R Block account and found a few documents, one of which clearly showed that a Maryland return was within the scope of work we agreed to and, further, that we owed the state. I could not find anywhere that indicated a date of filing for any of our returns.

On September 24th, 2024, I called H&R Block customer service who stated that the Tax Pro who handled our 2020 taxes was no longer under their employ. Instead, she scheduled a call with a manager at a local year-round office (for anonymity, I'll call her Susan).

On September 25th, 2024, Susan called me and after reviewing the taxes that were in the system, relayed the following:

* The 2020 Tax Pro completed and filed our Federal and Virginia taxes, but did not complete or file our Maryland taxes. They were still showing as ""in progress.""
* After reviewing our Virginia taxes, she believed they were actually done incorrectly. At the time of filing, we did not owe any money nor were we getting a refund. She said that we should have actually received about an $80 refund.
* The Maryland taxes were originally showing we owed $1,400, but she believed they should be lower. The now completed filings show us owing $653.
* Susan claimed that there is a statute of limitations of 3 years on refunds, so it would not make sense to file an amended return in Virginia.

Susan then said that I would need to visit a local branch for them to print our Maryland returns and we would need to pay the processing fee. She also stated we would be responsible for paper filing to the state. She said that she would try to get me a discount on the processing fee. I told Susan I wasn't as worried about the processing fee as I was penalties the state will likely assess. I told her that I'd prefer H&R Block to file on my behalf, along with a letter of explanation to the state of Maryland, and cover any associated penalties. Susan told me that we would need to file them ourselves, then submit the penalties as a reimbursement request once paid to the state, and that H&R Block would likely say that it was the customer's (our) fault for not following up when they weren't filed timely. I told her I understood the process as she explained. At this point, I didn't want to push back too hard in fear of getting my tax documents held up and further delay them being filed.

On September 28th, 2024, I met with a Tax Pro at another local H&R Block office to receive the printed forms (again, I'll call him Keith). Keith saw the now completed Maryland return but said he needed signatures from both myself and my wife. He was able to print the signature forms but said I needed to pay the processing fee before giving me the paper returns. As Susan mentioned, the fee was discounted. However, he experienced technical issues trying to get the point of sale system to bring up the sale for transaction. He advised me to go home, get my wife's signature, and then return. He called me on my way home and said the system was still not working correctly and asked if I could come back later in the week. We made an appointment for today at 2:30.

Today, my wife went back to the H&R Block office and they were able to bring up the sale for transaction and give her the paper forms. It appears the anticipated penalty amount to the state will be about $6,000.

We are planning to send the return by certified mail, along with a check for the amount that we owe, and a letter of explanation including the description of events above.

My questions:

* Should we communicate this directly to the state of Maryland or does H&R Block have any responsibility to do so on our behalf?
* Should we follow H&R Block's policy by paying any associated penalties and then filing a dispute claim or is there another avenue you recommend we take?
* Is there any need for us to seek legal representation in our communications with either H&R Block or the state?

Anecdotally, I just want all of this to be wrapped up. I have never written a bad review of a company or anything like this, but I am so incredibly frustrated. I am a very diligent person and it makes me feel like I've failed as a citizen by not filing and paying our taxes. I'm frustrated with H&R Block because we paid for a specific service with a specific scope of work and are basically being treated as if it's our fault they didn't complete it. We've now had several stressful calls and in-office visits with out much resolution aside from ""whoops, sorry about that. You'll need to file it yourself.""

I know I'm probably a bit biased due to my proximity to this issue, so I'm hoping you all can provide some insight or any info that can help point us in the right direction. Thanks!

TLDR; H&R Block failed to file our state taxes in 2020 and now we could potentially owe a $6,000 penalty and they don't seem too inclined to take any responsibility for it.

Is it just hiring a tax pro once per year to file for me? Or are there extra forms to fill out on quarterly estimated payments now too? Should I be paying a CPA monthly as well?

Reddit,Accountable,Talk me off the ledge…,"This year I opted for an EA to do my taxes. I met with her earlier in the year for some tax planning and when I had all my documentation I submitted everything. She was in the hospital for 5 weeks during tax season and only got back to returns the couple weeks before Apr 15. So needless to say they were rushed to finish everything. So on Apr 12 I get notice the taxes are done and some docusign to sign. When I see the return, finally, I see a minor error and when I call to have it corrected they tell me they have already filed the return. I was not pleased, as I expected to be able to review and reject if I felt necessary (this was my first time with this preparer). How did they file without our signatures?? They insisted they could not make the minor correction as it had been already filed and did not involve any numbers (it was for a 1099 my sole proprietorship issued and they checked the “no” box). Okay. Then I realize there was no documentation of my authorization to withdraw my tax payment from my account. I requested this several times but it has not arrived. They did send some un-badged document that says the return was accepted - with a submission ID and the tax preparer’s info on it. Federal only. I still have not received confirmation of state submittal. The problem is that when I log into the irs through id.me I do not see that the return was submitted or pending. I only see income forms for 2023. No funds have left my account. So, should I be concerned? I can’t confirm independently it was submitted or my taxes were authorized to be withdrawn.

Reddit,Accountable,"For 2023, someone else's tax payment went to our account, resulting in a much larger refund. I notified them. What will happen next?","So for the tax year 2023, we did our taxes like normal but then the refund was taking a while. I eventually (like 2 months later) reached out to the IRS and they informed me our return ""was pulled for closer analysis"", or something like that. After a lot of calls and back and forth, they finally informed me that there was an error (on their part) and that they'd work on it. Was told to call back if I hadn't heard from them or received our refund in a certain amount of time.

Eventually the refund came through. This was in like July. However, the refund was $9k more than expected. I called them an informed them of this. They said that was indeed an error and after further review they said someone else's estimated tax payment was accidentally applied to our account.

They offered no real solutions. They asked us if we'd be willing to call our back to ""cancel the deposit"". I said no, because some of that refund was actually ours and we had already waited several months for it. They understood. After more time and back and forth, he finally said that we just need to keep an eye on some mail correspondence from them on next steps. This was a few months ago now.

We just have the $9k parked in a HYSA.

Reddit,Accountable,I think I missed up my quarterly estimated tax payments. What now?,"In addition to W2 wages I am getting unpredictable income from dividends as well as realized capital gains. So I need to pay quarterly estimated taxes. My goal was to have my usual W2 wage withholding and the quarterly payments match pretty close to my total tax bill. I thought I was doing it correctly, but I recented reviewed my records and found out that I underpaid Q1 and Q2 estimated taxes because I suck at accounting.

I am trying to figure out my options. I really would like to avoid a penalty if possible.

It sounds like it possible to use a safe harbor and then pay the difference when I file at end of year.

My 2023 taxes were 25,000 (rough numbers for example). I believe my 2024 taxes will be around 30,000 thanks to my gains.

The safe harbor says I need to pay 110% of the prior year so that would be 25,000 x 1.10 = 27,500.

So far I have paid 17,500 in witholding from my wages. I also made about 2000 in quarterly payments. Is it possible to increase my withholding to hit the safe harbor minimum of 27,500 and then pay any remainder when I file at end of year? I am worried because the withholding payments are being paid very late in the year now.

So 27,500 - 17,500 = 10,000 still owed to reach the safe harbor.

10,000 divided by the next four months in 2,500 per month. My usual withholding is about 2,000 per month so this is an increase in witholding of 500 which should be easy to afford. Then I pay the remainder when I file taxes for 2024.

Will this work? Or should I just stop paying for now and pay the penalty at end of year when I file?",2024-08-27 22:27:03,1.0,6.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Indiana state possible audit,"I received a letter from my states (Indiana) dept of revenue that basically sounds like an audit and I’m looking for some advice/guidance. For some background- I started a side business back in 2021 that receives 1099 income. My question is- what happens if I am unable to produce the proof of my business expenses? Or even the 1099 for that matter? I admittedly was majorly slacking on keeping documentation and records. I’m assuming they would throw out those “expenses” and then charge me taxes on what the income that those expenses offset? What if I’m not able to support ALL of the expenses but can some- so for example a mileage deduction: what if I can only show support for 75 percent of the mileage? Do they throw all of them out or only toss the 25 percent I was unable to prove? 
My side business is just starting and doesn’t make much money and after it was all said and done I claimed a 13k dollar loss on it and had approx. 7k in 1099 receipt for it. This was in addition to my approx. 170k w2 income. So I guess the side business lowered my agi by 13k but what if I can only prove that it should have lowered it only say 6k?

Reddit,Accountable,Help! My taxes have me spiraling!,"Sorry for the long post, I'm word vomiting because I'm panicking. 

I made less than $10,000 this year, and I lost my job. I got and  looked over my w2 this morning, and calculated a general idea of what I would get back (around $900). Except it's not that easy, because I was requested to join the Amazon product review program (Amazon vine), and misunderstood the details in the tax portion, and that's gonna be something I have to pay back, its just barely over $3,000. 

In the tax section of the vine participant agreement, it says, in more legal terms than this, that the vine participant is responsible for the taxes on items received. However when I got my tax statement from the vine program, I am going to be charged the full price of everything I received, not just the taxes on those items. Or at least that's the way it seems in the paperwork. So if it's the way it seems, I'm gonna come out owing just over $2,000, and I am still looking for a job. 

I have $14 in my bank account, and I'm gonna have to use my credit card to pay my bills in February, which if I'm lucky I'll get a job before March, and I'll have to use the credit card for gas as well but I'll be able to pay it off when I get paid. I am not a lucky person though.

So what happens if you're unemployed, and can't pay back your taxes? I know about the payment plan options, but as I said I have $14 in my bank account, and no income, so I'm not going to be able to make a down payment or payments until I'm lucky enough to get a job. What am I supposed to do? Am I gonna get screwed by the IRS and sent to prison? Because that's how it was taught in my schools, you owe the IRS money, and don't pay for whatever reason, you go to prison. I know they can garnish wages and stuff because my father has been dealing with it for like two years, he owed and couldn't make the payments, and they started garnishing his wages, and just never stopped, he gets like 5 checks a week paying him back because his debt was paid, but they won't stop garnishing his wages, and he can't get in contact with anyone. I don't really want to deal with that headache, so of course I'm gonna try everything in my power to be able to pay, but right now I dont have any income and I've got no way of paying the irs back, so am I going to end up in prison? I won't survive in prison. 

I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, and with my current financial situation I can't make payments, I'm probably gonna have to cut off my phone just to be able to make ends meet until I can get a job, I've already cut everything unnecessary out of my budget, like streaming services, internet, and food. The only bills remaining are my car insurance ($50) and my phone ($20). I'm lucky I don't have to pay rent, I live with  my grandpa, because I'd get evicted. I'm 22, I'm an adult, but I was never taught how to handle situations like this, and I feel like a little kid getting screamed at for not knowing how to do the math homework. 

My finances have caused so many panic attacks because I didn't make enough to put anything into savings, and I lost my job because I was looking for a better paying job, so that I could actually put something in my savings so that I could afford to live on my own when the time comes, maybe put a down payment on a small piece of property and buy an old trailer to put on that property so that I don't have to pay the insane and constantly rising rent prices. 

I need help, I need to know what I should do, what I can do, anything. I need adult advice because I don't know how to be an adult. I was just tossed into being grown, and despite essentially being on my own since I was 15, the only thing provided was housing and dinner because I ran away and ended up with my grandparents, I have no idea how to be an adult, and deal with stuff like this, and I'm spiraling, I know there's a logical way to deal with this but the only thing I was ever taught about the irs was pay or prison, and I'm panicking because I currently have no way to pay.

Reddit,Accountable,Somone filed taxes in my husbands name HELP! ,"I looked through the sub to see if this has happened to anyone else and couldn't find anything so sit down for a long story.

My husband and I have filed Married Filed Jointly since 2017 with no issues. We normally E-file but our 2023 E-file wasn't accepted the error we received was that my husband's AGI was incorrect. I thought it was just a glitch and we filed via paper in April 2024.  Fast forward to yesterday 9/24/24 we received a letter from the IRS stating our 2023 refund was being applied towards tax debt from our 2022 filing. normally receive a few hundred dollars of return each year so this was a surprise.   
  
I logged in to my IRS account to review our joint tax documents and figure out how we messed up but each return on my account showed that we owed the IRS $0.00. I checked my husband's account and all of his returns matched up to the ones in my account except for 2022. Someone filed a return in November of 2023 for 2022 taxes AFTER we filed our 2022 taxes in February of 2023. They also filed single and only under my husband's name after we filed jointly. The person who filed under my husband's name wound up owing over $6,000 and I just don't understand what the benefit would be for them to do this when they didn't get any money by filing.   
  
The IRS told us to complete a 14039 form to report fraud but it is taking on average 650 days to complete a fraud investigation! Our son is going to college next year and we will need to complete his FASFA information and I'm worried this will impact his federal aid.   
  
Has this ever happened to anyone else? I don't understand why this second tax filing was allowed to be submitted when my husband's social had already been used to file 2022's taxes nearly 9 months prior and how the IRS accepted a single tax filing after the April cut-off when we already filed jointly.

Reddit,Accountable,How do you calculate income taxes for a fiscal year that does not match the calendar year?  How do you account for 1099s that you will get at the end of the calendar year?,"I am working on 1041 for an Estate.  As directed by my attorney, we will submit taxes for the 12-month period from the date-of-death.

It is a very small Estate, and the taxes should be simple.

However, there are two sources of income that will generate 1099s at the end of 2024:  A bank account that earned some interest and the sale of some stock for a small capital loss of $454 on a sale of about $2,000 worth of stock.

I have an exact number for the interest income, so that will not be a surprise.  However, I do not know what the 1099 from Computershare will show for gains/losses.

I can fill out a form 8949 with my estimates.  What happens if the eventual 1099 from Computershare does not match?

Maybe this is all moot anyway, since the attorney fees exceed any income for the year, so no tax will be owed in any case.

I will meet with my attorney for review of my work before submitting. Thanks for any suggestions, in the meantime.

Reddit,Accountable,Seeking Advice: VAT Liability and Amazon Account Block in the UK after Company Closure Process,"On June 6, 2023, a consultancy firm in Turkey established a company for me in the UK, claiming that I was exempt from VAT. However, in February 2024, Amazon blocked my seller account, stating that my company was not established in accordance with UK company law, and they froze the balance in my account. In response, in March, I appointed a UK-based accountant with British citizenship as the director of the company and transferred the company’s address to a real location. Additionally, I obtained a VAT exemption letter from a UK certified chartered accountant.
To have the account block lifted, I provided Amazon with the following documents:
• A recent invoice for goods or services used for the operation of the business within the last 180 days.
• Invoices covering at least 6 months of co-working space rentals showing physical presence in the co-working space.
• Bank statements from my director’s local UK bank account.
• My director's UK driver’s license.
• My director's residential electricity bill.
• VAT exemption letter obtained from a certified chartered accountant.
• Companies House documents proving our physical presence and compliance with UK regulations.
After submitting these documents, Amazon lifted the block and released the funds to my bank account. On July 6, I filed a tax return, which showed a loss, based on the accountant’s calculations. Subsequently, on July 16, I applied for the company’s closure. However, one week later, Amazon blocked my account again and sent the following message:
""Based on the review of your account and the documentation you shared, we completed our verification and determined that you were established in the UK for Value Added Tax (VAT) purposes since 28-Feb-24YYY. As a result of this assessment, Amazon must collect and remit the VAT associated with your sales for the period 01/01/21 to 27/02/24 when you were not established in the UK. We completed our final assessment and determined the final VAT liability you owe is 5,884.79 GBP. Your final VAT liability may differ from the preliminary liability provided to you earlier as we have finalized all your transactions which are eligible under this legislation.""
Despite the earlier advice that companies with an annual turnover below £85,000 are exempt from VAT, this VAT liability has emerged.
I am now seeking advice on whether I am obligated to pay this VAT amount, whether this liability will hinder the closure of my company, and whether the current director will bear any financial responsibility. I also require legal assistance to liaise with HMRC and Amazon to resolve this issue and facilitate the proper closure of my company and Amazon account.

Reddit,Accountable,1040 NR help,"I am F1 Visa student, I field tax manually for the year 22 and using glacier prep for year 23 but In March 2024, I received a notice stating that I owe $967.83 because I reported $0 taxable income, believing the standard deduction applied to my entire gross income of $9,606 for the financial year 2022. However, the IRS removed the deduction, stating that I am ineligible.

This is incorrect, as I meet the requirements for the standard deduction. I’m an F1 student from India, and my income was below the standard deduction of $12,950 for 2022.

I contacted the IRS multiple times, making over 20–30 calls, but no one seemed to understand the issue. One of them told I am a us citizen, one representative advised me to file an amended return, which I did. After waiting two months with no response, I contacted them again in August, only to be told to call someone else who process NR forms.

1. The first year I found the “best” as per Google reviews and very expensive who filed my taxes but asked me to pay $xxxx to release one of the calculations they did when IRS audited my taxes. I created a thread about the ethics of that using my old Reddit account on this subReddit and people unanimously agreed that he was on the wrong and I should report him. 
2. I found another one who didn’t know about 1341 and told me the money I overpaid last year is gone and I can’t get it back. 
3. This year I used a friend’s preparer who missed SO many details, like not including AMT from ISO (causing a difference of 20k+) and ignoring cost basis for ESPP. 


For each of these situations I was very heavily involved in scrutinising the files they created, and redid all the math myself, while learning about the rules. While that’s great, it takes a lot more of my time and I’m envious about the freedom I can have if I find someone I can trust for two three years. 

So TLDR : I’m fairly involved and have learnt a thing or two about taxes because of bad experiences with tax pros. What’s a good way to find them? Google or referrals haven’t worked.

Reddit,Accountable,"Didn't know the answer for 2 stock tax form boxes, entered 0 for both. Will I/ what happens if I owe the irs money?","Hi all. I've been doing my taxes solo via turbo tax for about 3 or 4 years now. So far, no problems.

Until this year, where, randomly, at the end of my taxes I was asked to review something I'd missed from my income.

It was information that, by all accounts, should have been imported from fidelity (I don't know much about stocks but I do light dabbling) along with the rest of my information, but just wasn't for some reason.

So here I am, ready to be done with taxes, and im basically being told ""Hey, we need you to get this ultra specific info from your 2021 taxes and figure out how it varies from your 2022 taxes in this ultra specific stock tax form, but we aren't going to tell you how to find it or what to look for. Have fun!""

Naturally, I searched around for an answer, even took to Google, and after an hour of completely unnecessary stress, I just entered 0 into the box.

It then asked me to do the same process for a different box, and I entered 0 again, and then I was finally done.

Due to how little I dabble in stocks, I don't think the amount mattered and definitely wasn't worth as much stress as it put me through, and frankly I have no clue why turbo tax couldn't just auto import it since I've done my taxes on there for the last few years (and I'm pretty sure they charged me to import my stock info smh).

For more info, this is all the info they gave me to find the number for the box. 

TY21 Sch D AMT ln 7

Anyway, my taxes are filed. My refund of around 3k didn't seem noticeably affected after I went back and entered the zeros into the two boxes. I am now only looking for reassurance of what will happen going forward. 

I googled and Google claims irs can fix small mistakes without the need to amend taxes (and i really dont want to amend over that bs). I figure if they look into it and see the two random 0's, it will be noticeable enough for them to quickly fix, hopefully. Though i honestly have no clue if what I entered lost or ""earned"" me a little bit of money, or made no difference at all. 

I guess my TL;DR question is this: If you don't know the answer to a stock tax form question and enter 0 on the TY21 Sch D AMT ln 7 box, as well as an additional box, will it either be a: no big deal, b: something that requires you to amend your taxes, or c) something that will make you owe money to the irs.

And if you do owe money to the irs, do they just mail you a form with details for you to pay online? I've never owed money but would be fine needing to pay a little as long as I don't need to do it through snail mail, its the worst.",2024-02-07 03:34:27,5.0,23.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Please need advice on high back tax situation,"Hello. I am in a bit of a state at the moment- so please be gentle with me and forgive any oversight in providing additional information. Ask me any questions that would be helpful. (obvi throwaway account, but I will be kind and keep everyone updated as I go through this process for helpers, voyeurs, and those in a similar situation later.) FYI for ease, I have combined my and my husbands income, but all details are otherwise accurate, if estimated)

TL:DR- Due to misunderstanding, and life circumstances, I missed the deadline to dispute a recalculation of my taxes owed in 2020. I now have a ""Notice of Intent to Levy"" for an amount I truly believe I don't owe. Even if I do owe it, I cannot pay this amount (almost 80k). Does anyone have any ideas on what to do? Details below. 

  
I have willingly and faithfully filed and paid taxes all though my working life. I had the extreme luck of working with a company that managed to ""hit it big"" and ended up with about 700k in stock to sell.  I sold in two bunches, in the 2019 and 2020 tax years. 

In 2019 I had \~450k in income- 150k, salary, 300k sale of stock- and paid \~52k in tax at my tax filing. (i.e. not counting taxes taken as part of payroll)

In 2020, I had \~510k in income- 150k, salary, 360k sale of stock- and paid 60k in taxes at filing. (i.e. not counting taxes taken as part of payroll)

This seems reasonable, yet the IRS has me with a due balance of 66k (pre-penalties) in the 2020 tax year (so over double what I previously paid)

I received several letters from the IRS regarding these 2019 and 2020 filings. I had some back-and-forth with the IRS back in 2022, it turned out that my company reported income from sold shares on the ""wages, salary, tips"" line in my W2, but when the IRS did a review of my account, the IRS separately counted the stock sale thinking it was unreported (so my 150k salary, plus 350 of sold stock, appeared as one line item = 450 salary in reality, but the IRS looked at it as 450k salary plus 350k sold stock) thus nearly doubling my income. This was corrected and I ended up owing no additional tax. I have the information for this from the 2019 tax year- which was resolved in 2022. 

This is where I f\*ed up. I had thought that the 2019 and 2020 issues were resolved at the same time. I had 2 more babies (making 4 kids total) in the time the IRS letters were coming, I have two jobs, my husband has a job and a business on the side, we care for my parents etc etc. busy life. I know these are excuses, but it is also real life. Today I received the ""Notice of Intent to Levy"" letter and was shocked. I have spent a few hours going through everything and realize the enormous error I have made- i.e. I thought 2020 was resolved along with 2019, but it was not. it is an identical accounting issue (same company, same set up of W2 etc)

Questions:

1. Is there any recourse at this point for disputing the additional tax itself? I truly believe this is an accounting error and not a true debt (please let me know if you think otherwise)

2. If not, is there any reasonable chance of getting some kind of payment extension? i can pay about 11k in liquid asset and put another 35k or so on credit cards, but I don't  have access to more than that (we JUST finished a home renovation given the additional kids we added and are basically out of money.) I get a bonus in March where we could complete the payment

3. Who to contact: Can I speak with the IRS directly, do I need a lawyer? I have looked into tax relief things online, but they seem scammy- are there any good ones I can contact? ",2024-08-24 20:51:04,1.0,2.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,At what point do your report fraud?,"Anonymous account. 

My wife was asked by a relative (“John”) to help get John’s finances together and more organized. My wife is an accountant, but does audit not tax. Upon reviewing  John’s finances and hearing stories, she thinks it is probable that they are deducting things that should not be deducted. Things like taking a trip for fun and making one business phone call so the entire trip is deducted. John’s wife is going back to school for a new career and is deducting tuition from her current job as a realtor. 

What is considered fraud and what amount is worth being concerned about? 

I am of the opinion that one should not go looking for trouble, and the small man with few resources and just starting out gets some slack. John, though, is worth >2 million, owns multiple properties, has been doing this for years, and has asked for my wife’s involvement. 

I should note that my wife has suggested to John that she believes some of these expense aren’t deductible, and she was agitatedly dismissed. We are thinking of ways to broach the subject again.

I have been reading a lot of negative reviews about payusatax and pay1040 but not many recent posts and really nothing on ACI so any feedback would be awesome!",2024-04-29 20:39:01,0.0,10.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Withdrawing Roth IRA Contributions without all 8606 Forms,"I am considering withdrawing some of the contributions from my Roth IRA as I think I have more than needed for retirement. I am starting to review the mechanics of how to withdraw roth IRA contributions.

I have a spreadsheet with all my roth contributions but I want to have documentation to prove it in the event of an audit.



What I have and don't have:

- I am missing several tax returns that are older than 7 years and don't seem to have any method to get them. 

- I have contacted my financial institution and have all the form 5498s for every year where I did the backdoor Roths.

- I also have some rollovers that were done from an After-tax 401k to a Roth IRA. For those years, I have a 4098 showing the rolled over amount. Would I need the 1099-R related to this?

  
For the Future: I also have funds sitting in my 401k as source ""in-plan Roth conversion account""that can be rollovered to an IRA while working at the company.  I would like to rollover to a Roth IRA this year. When I file taxes next year, what would I need to prove the contribution portion of that? Just historical 1099-Rs? I can also ask my institution for end of year statements for the years where I contributed.

Reddit,Accountable,Estate Tax Closing Letter vs Account Transcript transaction code “421”,"Question for all of you more knowledgeable than me. Generally the practice for most large estates is to receive a closing letter for a 706 Tax return, however with the Notice 2017-12 it appears that an account transcript with a 421 transaction code indicating a closing of the review of the tax return can be used in lieu of a formal closing letter.

My question is whether the tax code or other regulations offer MORE protection for a fiduciary filing that 706 tax return if they obtain a closing letter as opposed to relying on the 421 coded account transcript.

Is there any justifiable reason for a fiduciary to now wait for the Estate Tax Closing Letter if the account transcript has the same legal significance? ",2024-07-26 16:07:34,1.0,1.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,"NYS never received my 2019 taxes, but Federal did? Efiled","Hi there, 

Just received a letter from NYS, they claimed they never received my taxes for 2019. the more I looked into it, looks like NYS never received it. Called my tax guy he claims ""it was processed"" but his software doesn't keep of filings past 3 years.  This seems highly suspect that there isn't a time sample on file when it was efiled.   
Looking at the draft copy he sent me and his signature forms it said auto withdrawal of funds from my bank account. On the final copy he sent me, the summary sheet said to mail a check. my normal process is to read my entire draft copy and then sign. This was our process for so many years I worked with him.  We always did auto width drawl and never had an issue, so I never thought to actually check that the final copy would be any different.  He even told me I am the 1% that actually reads what he preps. Big mistake that I didn't review the final copy

Calling NYS they didn't receive 2019 tax forms, nor did they receive any payments. check my bank account statements around those times. Still nada. 

NYS rep told me to file asap, and when the bill is generated you can write a letter and plea your case. she was going to note something in my file then we got disconnected. She seemed like human though. 

Question for you guys, do tax software keep a proof of error or of successful submission on file? is it really 3 years? I have a hard time believing that. I've used him for so many years, while hes been an excellent tax person, when it comes to owning up to mistakes, hes a bit dodgy.   
  
Q1) besides pleaing, is there anything else I can do here? Are there any other confirmations that can be dug up?  I am of course going to submit as soon as he sends me what I need to send. and write a letter point my signatures.

Q2) Whats the likely hood of NYS dropping penalties and or interest? Gut is saying yes to penalties but probably not the interest. 

Big lessons learned: Going to add to my process, Keep proof of electronic filing confirmations. and proof payment went to and from my bank account every year moving forward. 

Thanks.

Reddit,Accountable,Terrified for What I Might Owe,"I have not filed for 2022 and 2023 yet. I have been a 1099 ""self employed"" contractor throughout these periods.

Throughout 2022, I had legal residency in a European country, where I spent the majority of the year, but was in the US visiting family for about 3 months. I may be disqualified from FEIE as a result, for which I claimed in previous years.

In 2023, I got rid of my residence lease in favor of doing the digital nomad lifestyle, living out of AirBnBs for extended periods. I spent about 3 months in the US in 2023 as well.

All that said, my visa for the European country is technically valid until 2026, so there might be a chance I can leverage for FEIE?

Total earnings as calculated from what hit my US bank in 2022 and 2023 are below, along with tallied AirBnB and rent expenses since I work from my domicile and believe I can use these as deductions.

2022: $108,961.93, I have a formal 1099 form from only one of my clients, which is listed as $58,750. Could I potentially just use this number? The rest of the $ was calculated by going through my monthly bank statements from 2022 and reviewing how much came into my account each month. Not sure if that is necessary or to only go with what there is a paper trail for.

2023: $118,064.68

AirBnB Expenses 2022:$12,169.8 (AirBnB) $11,760 (rent)

AirBnB Expenses 2023: $20,880.69

How bad is it? Very anxious at the prospect of potentially having to owe over $20K and am wondering if there is any thing that can turn the tide here. I am speaking with a CPA next week but would appreciate any insight or ballpark figures to help ease or justify the stress.",2024-05-12 05:20:26,2.0,8.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Excess Roth Contribution Math and Next Steps,"Hi All!

I realized this afternoon that I have been making some ineligible contributions to Roth IRAs over the past few years (have not received any sort of notification from IRS though) and am looking for some help in reviewing the math and next steps to correct those those excess contributions. Would greatly appreciate any help in reviewing this!

**Contributions by Tax Year**

2021-$3,000

2022-$3,000

2023-$3,000

2024-$1,500



From what I can gather, these are the next steps to satisfy these erroneous contributions with the IRS:

* Amend 2021 Tax return and pay penalty of 6% on $3,000 ($180) via Form 5329

* Amend 2022 Tax return and pay penalty of 6% on $6,000 ($360) via Form 5329

* Recharacterize 2023 and 2024 contributions as Traditional IRA ($4,500) via IRA custodian

* Withdraw 2021 and 2022 contributions ($6,000) and contribute to traditional IRA via IRA custodian

* Amend/File extended 2023 return and pay penalty of ($X) via Form 5329, AND report qualified distribution 
of $6,000 at line 20 of form 5329 to fully resolve the excess contributions

* Leave earnings from 2021 and 2022 in Roth IRA account and contribute to Traditional IRA moving forward

**Additional Questions**

 * For X: For 2023, am I paying the penalty on the 2021, 2022, and 2023 contributions? Or am I able to recharacterize the 2023 contributions now and only pay the penalty on the existing 2021 and 2022 contributions?

 * Is filing an amended return for 2023 within the 6 months extensions are available post-April 15, automatically covered or do I need to take additional steps to file for an extension?

Reddit,Accountable,Would I be liable?,"So Im in somewhat of an odd situation. Its probably more cut & dry than Im thinking but every time I reach out, I get mixed answers so I thought I'd try here and see what you folks have to say.

  
So for context, in 2018, I filed an LLC with my father and it was 50/50. We did good until things started to come to realization with me that I didnt want to be self employed my entire life, I'd rather do what I gotta do and get taken care of. On January 3rd, 2022 I began my career with another business effectively leaving the family business but did not think of taking myself off of the LLC. From that point, I had no involvement with the LLC. On July 11, 2022 my father who owned the other 50% of the LLC passed away suddenly leaving behind unpaid taxes for the 2022 year and his estate was not able to pay them. Over the course of two years now, they have racked up penalties and interest to an amount that I am having a hard time figuring out how I can pay as I was not receiving the notices the IRS was sending because I was not living at the address that the LLC was filed to.

  
I have talked to his accountant who told me to talk to an IRS agent. I spoke with multiple agents over the phone who could not give me a definite answer and that it would be smart to make an appointment at the local office and review this in person. I made an appointment and we (I & my fathers estate holder) attended it two weeks ago. The gentleman was surprised I was even able to make an appointment with them as that specific office only deals with personal taxes, not business taxes so all he could do was refer me to the IRS Business Office in my state, which is roughly 6 hours away and not feasible for me to do. His other referral was to contact the IRS Business Department line, which I had already spoken with multiple agents there and nobody could give me a straight answer and was referred to making an appointment, basically making a pointless loop with no answer for me. 

  
So my TLDR question - Am I liable for unpaid payroll taxes if I had no involvement during those periods but remained as 50% owner of the LLC after the other 50% partner passed away?

  
Again, I realize this is probably cut & dry and I am liable but nobody, even the IRS, can seem to give me a definite straight forward answer.

Reddit,Accountable,Need Advice: Navigating Taxes and Budgeting as a New 1099 Contractor,"Edit: I meant to change the title, I am not a new contractor. But I just recently started trying to get my ducks in a row.

I'm a young professional who was hired for a contracting gig and have been working in this role for a few years. I've mostly taught myself and received some internal training at this company. I had to figure out all the contracting details on my own and missed some essential steps when I joined. Now, I'm trying to get on the right track and avoid further issues.

Context: Please don't judge me, but I had no clue about taxes, calculating income, expenses, write-offs, etc as I was completely new to this career space, and a young person living alone. The jargon alone is extremely overwhelming and confusing. I thought that as long as I was filing annually, I'd be okay. I was hired by someone close to me who knew I had no knowledge of contracting. Of course, it's not their job to educate me, but there was no clarity or honesty about how the position was framed in terms of if i was employed or contracted. They were a small startup and treated me as a salary, full time employee who was required to attend meetings, review, quarterly gradings, etc. I had only worked W2 jobs thus far, and didn't realize I was legally a 1099 contractor until someone else on my team mentioned it. Naturally, I ended up with a big tax bill at the end of the first year because I didn't know about paying quarterly taxes. This situation sent me into a spiral, making me feel stupid for not knowing or understanding any of this when I was hired. INB4 someone says ""the company you worked for was doing something illegal"" I'm fresh on what they did wrong, my sister was able to explain to me how they took advantage of me. So, i'm trying to avoid those flags as I go foward

Right now, I'm trying to pay down my current tax bill and get a fresh start. I bought Intuit QuickBooks for the first time, but I still feel lost about my top priorities for getting organized and budgeting properly as a solo business owner. Any beginner info (in layman's terms) would be super helpful. Apologies if this post doesn't include enough personal info—I'm happy to share more in the comments.

Here's what I can provide off the top of my head:

* I understand tax write-offs, but other than keeping physical receipts, I'm not sure how to maximize them.
* I know I can make monthly, quarterly, and annual tax payments, but I'm unsure how to calculate these and how to choose what to put aside.
* My income before taxes is approximately $70k USD. I lived in a high cost-of-living area until recently and worked hard to reach this pay range after making significantly less.
* Live in the State of Ohio
* I work on an hourly wage.
* Right now, my income comes directly into a personal banking account. I set aside money in my high yield savings and pay bills, and pretty much the rest lives in my easy access checking or savings. Should I start a business account and how should I split up these checks to pay myself and my taxes?
* I have no benefits or insurance.
* I file as single with no children.
* I rent an apartment.
* I work from home with minimal equipment and expenses (apart from living costs, occasional travel, and life essentials).
* I file with the IRS as a sole proprietor under ""\[business name they had me come up with\] Enterprises."" Do I need to create and start paying for a separate LLC?

Reddit,Accountable,Saved by the incompetence or just screwed differently? From LLC to S-Corp and Back Again,"I started an LLC in 2022. As the sole owner, I immediately elected to be taxed as an S-corp via my registered agent, and conducted my business accordingly. This is where the problems begin. It turns out that he IRS never acted on (or received according to them) the S-corp designation form from my registered agent, and therefore in 2022 and 2023 I was considered an LLC for tax purposes. I immediately reached out to the IRS, let them know that they should have designated me as an S-corp and I have proof that the scorp election form was submitted on time in 2022. They said they would get back to me within 16 weeks. They further informed that my 2022 business return had never been processed because I was never officially designated an S-corp so they could not accept an s-corp return. They also never mailed me or informed me of this...they just waited until I called... In any event as this was getting messy, I decided to file an extension on my 2023 business tax and personal tax returns until I had more clarity on my 2022 situation.

Entirely separately, while waiting to hear from the IRS, I went back and reviewed my 2022 business return and personal return. What I found was somewhat horrifying. My now ex-accountant had filed my 2022 business tax return as an S-corp, but then when he filed my personal return, he failed to attach my schedule k-1 🤯🤯😳😳. So effectively, the 40k in profits my company made, which should have been recorded as distributions for tax year 2022 on my personal return (even though I actually transferred the profits to my personal account in 2023) never had any taxes paid on them. After a bit of panic I came to the conclusion that an amended 2022 personal tax return was required and that I would just have to urgently pay the taxes owed , as well as penalties. But regardless, I still needed to hear from the IRS confirming they had fixed my S-corp designation.

Fast forward to today, and sure enough today I got a letter from the IRS saying they have confirmed my s-corp election, but because I did not submit in a timely manner, the designation is only effective as of 2024. 🤔🤔🤔

My immediate reaction was "" holy f-ing sh\*t. this saga just does not want to end!"" When I had called the IRS agent on the phone previously, they had told me they did not need the proof that I had submitted my s-corp designation form in 2022, because this happens all of the time. Well, that simply did not turn out to be true.

**So, riddle me this Reddit:** Was I actually saved by the fact that for 2022 my business was an LLC and not a Scorp? Or is it more beneficial to fight the man.

**Option 1: Saved by incompetence:** In this option, I Just run with it, consider myself lucky and retroactively consider my business an LLC for 2022 and 2023. The logic being that LLCs allow for retained earnings, and so rather than filing an amended 2022 return, I could just submit a 2023 return that shows my business distributed the retained earnings from 2022 to the sole owner in 2023.  There would be no amended return and no penalties for failure to pay what would have amounted to unreported k-1 income had I my scorp election gone through in 2022. The cost of this approach would be that I have to pay the 15.3% FICA for employee and employer on the 40k of profits. So about $6ish k

**Option 2: Fight the man:** In this option, I push back and provide the IRS proof that I elected to be taxed as an Scorp in 2022, and have my tax status updated retroactively accordingly. My 2022 scorp business return gets released from IRS purgatory and promptly let me know I owe back taxes and have penalties to pay. I would have to file my amended 2022 personal return to report the k-1 income, pay the taxes owed on the distribution, and pay whatever penalties come my way. The only benefit of this approach that I see would not be paying FICA on the taxes. The cost would be paying penalties, having to fight more, and looking bad in the eyes of the IRS and potentially opening myself to further scrutiny (which would be fine--nothing to hide, but aint nobody got time for an audit).

**Is there an option 3? Is my logic correct in option 1 and option 2? Am I neglecting anything major? What would you do and why?**

Reddit,Accountable,Should I Spend the $ to Professionally Get My W2 Reviewed?,"Hey everyone!

I am currently 21, and working for a nuclear laboratory in New Mexico. I got hired back in October of 2022, and as part of their hiring process, they gave me a ""full relocation package"" in which they paid for all moving expenses including car, flight, and personal stuff across the country. At first, I thought this was a great onboarding gift, but it turns out that they used it as a tax write-off and pushed the taxes onto me. 

**Overview**

* The total moving expense that was paid for by the lab came out to over $27,000
* They added the amount to my payslip on January of 2023
* I did not receive $23,000 to my payslip, I did not pay taxes on the $23,000 on my payslip, but it WAS added to my total gross amount
* As it was added in 2023, my taxes did not account for anything on the 2022 expensed taxes

Currently, I have run my W2 through ""freetaxusa"" and I owe over $6,000 in state taxes due to the $23,000 being added as part of my gross salary, and since I didn't pay the taxes on it, its saying I owe it now. Even though, it was not money that I ever received! They simply paid the moving company and used my name for the expense, and put the expense on my payslip. I then went to ""turbo-tax"" and it says that I'm receiving over $450 in tax returns. 

If anyone has any understanding of this or advice, please let me know. I'm wanting to just use turbo-tax, as it was the one I used last year, and it turned out fine, but my brain is telling me that I should fork over the \~$500 for a CPA to review this properly.

Reddit,Accountable,Backdoor Roth and Free Tax USA,"I followed [Finance Buff's instructions](https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-freetaxusa.html)  exactly on how to declare the Backdoor Roth on Free Tax USA. I put in both my and my spouse's 1099-R information (we're MFJ). We each did a Backdoor Roth for $6500 in 2023 (i.e., contributed $6500 to an empty Trad IRA account then transferred immediately to Roth). After completing the IRA deductions section on Free Tax USA, the IRA Deduction Summary says that we have $6500 eligible for deduction.

I have a Florida LLC since 2021, I've been filing my monthly sale & use tax returns online from [floridarevenue.com](https://floridarevenue.com)'s portal. Those of you know - you login with the Resale Certificate number that you're given as your username and partner number as your password.

I've been assigned a resale certificate in 2022 and I was using this resale certificate's number and doing my returns. I've done this with no problem for a long time.

In 2023 November - I was given a new resale certificate (probably because it renews every year) and I didnt feel the need to do anything about it.

For November - December 2023 and January and February 2024 I used  the same resale certificate and partner number login did my monthly returns and downloaded them as PDFs.

When we reached April I realized I can no longer login with my previous resale certificate login and that's when I realized I could login with the new one they sent me. So did I and I did my return for March thinking that - it was the only one I didnt do.

then I first received a We have not received your Tax Return Notifce on April 10th.

then I received a Notice of Final Assesment on April 17th,

and finally, I received the attached mail yesterday. and that's the moment I realized since the minute I received the new Resale certificate old login must have been cancelled BUT their system let me do all the returns so in my defense I thought everything was business as usual.

This morning I immediately filed all returns again. November, December 2023, Jan, Feb 2024.

Could anyone please advise what would be the best way to get away from this? If I call the number who sent me the notice would they make sense of it?

and why in the world is the fine is $3.367 per month x 4 ?? The 7% of the total sales for each month doesnt even make this amount.

I'd appreciate some help. Thank you for your time.

TLDR: I filed my sales and use tax with my old resale certificate login on floridarevenue.com for Nov-Dec 2023, Jan-Feb 2024. Not realizing that I should have used the new resale certificate login they provided me in November 2023. After receiving two notices (which I didnt realize in the moment) now I receive a fine that's asking me to pay 14K. Since I realized everything I did the missing returns with my most up to date resale certificate login. How can I solve this situation ASAP (please see attached pics for details)

So my situation is that my accountant accidently filed my recent state tax return for Kentucky and not Ohio where I lived and worked. He filed for Kentucky accidently as I moved back in with my family after quitting my job in Ohio last October. 
After originally reviewing my tax documents, my accountant estimated that l'd receive approx. $650 from state (though I dont know whether that was for Kentucky or Ohio) however he only recently notified me that he filed wrongly and that I now owe $3000 to Kentucky. He has since refiled with Ohio but says that I still owe $1500 to Kentucky, with Ohio covering for half of the total amount. To be clear I have not paid to or received from either state yet as well as never did I live, work, or commute from Kentucky while employed in Ohio.

Is there really no option for me to dispute the taxes claimed by Kentucky? I can easily prove that while I was making income I only lived and worked in Ohio. And if I can diapute it, what steps do I need to take?

Thanks for any and all help!

Reddit,Accountable,Question on timeframe of a 5017C,"I e-filed my taxes through H&R Block online on Jan 24th, the Wed before they officially started processing on the 29th.  When looking up my refund status about a week later it says my return is being reviewed for identity protection.  So I created an [id.me](https://id.me) account and logged into my IRS account.  It says I need to verify my identity and I'll need the information on a letter I'll be receiving in the mail such as a 5017C along with prior years tax records.  So far, I haven't received the letter.  So my question is, how long does it typically take to receive the letter in the mail?  And how long should I wait before reporting I didn't receive it and request a new one to be sent?  Has anyone else out there who filed early had the same thing happen and received their letter in the mail yet?  Thanks",2024-02-13 15:11:44,1.0,10.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,"The trustee of a trust has misappropriated funds, and this was discovered when asking the accountant doing the trust’s taxes what profit the trust made. What is the accountant’s role when something like this is discovered? ","Attempting to make a long story short, I am the beneficiary among several others of a trust my grandparents had. They left my aunt as trustee in the event of her passing, and per the trust agreement all of the “Edward Jones accounts” were to be split amongst the grandchildren. Per the trustee, there was an IRA with a certain amount, and that amount was split, and we were all sent checks. Fast forward to tax time, I was told I needed to give an accountant my ss#, so I asked that accountant what the profit was since we were told we would have to pay taxes on the profit and he stated there was an IRA with “x amount” in it that is 100% taxable. Shady thing is that “x amount” is $41k more than what the trustee told us was in the IRA. When I asked the trustee about this directly, she stated that $41k was rolled over to her personal retirement account per the wishes of her mother per a conversation the two of them had alone (this was not stated to be done per the trust agreement). 
 
The accountant told me he was going to ask for a copy of the trust and look everything over to make sure it’s being handled appropropriately. It’s been weeks now and the accountant won’t return my calls and we are being told by a receptionist that our K1’s are not ready and they still need to review everything but she is assuring me we will get them before the deadline. 

My question is, when the accountant looks over the trust agreement and sees that the trustee moved funds to herself for personal gain against what the trust agreement stated to do, is the accountant legally obligated to do anything? Especially since I as a beneficiary have expressed my concerns to him that funds have been mishandled? If you are an accountant reading this and you came across this type of situation, what do you do? ",2024-04-08 23:39:01,1.0,5.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Using California CalFile FTB gave me a W2 I don't recognize,"I'm using California's free tax software, CalFile to fill out my state taxes.

Reddit,Accountable,1031 Exchange Mistake - Deferred Loss!?,"I completed a 1031 Exchange 2 years ago and was reviewing Form 8824.  It looks like my CPA messed up the numbers, but they look so wrong that maybe it's my lack of understanding.

  
Sold 1M property and performed 1031 Exchange into 3 others.  $500k, $250k, $250k (Equity) into $1.2M, $500k, $500k properties.

Line 18 (Adjusted basis of like-kind property you gave up) shows $1.48M

Line 19 (Realized Loss/Gain) shows -$509k

Reddit,Accountable,What would be the best way to work with my employer?,"I'm not US citizen, I moved to the US from Ukraine under the United for Ukraine program a week ago. I can work under this program and have applied for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). I am currently waiting for an appointment to obtain a Social Security Number (SSN).

I used to work for a US-based IT company registered in California. I signed a W8-BEN form about 1.5 years ago, but this is now invalid since I'm in the US. 

The company I worked for is interested in continuing to work with me in the US. However, the company only has the CEO and an accountant as employees, and the CEO has as much knowledge as I do about how to do this properly.

1. What would be the simplest way for both parties to establish legal relations?
2. Should I consider being an independent contractor and filing a yearly Form 1099? Any tips for this approach?
3. Should I create an LLC and file for S-Corp status?
4. W-2 employment isn't feasible because the company is currently being reviewed for acquisition by a third-party company registered in Canada, which may change things.

How can I establish legal work relations with my employer being non-US citizen.

Reddit,Accountable,"Empty T-IRA goes from 0 to 6500 w/ only post-tax dollars, then a BD Roth conversion. Form 8606 says all 6500 is pre-tax dollars? Where am I going wrong?","Reviewing Form 8606 instructions to run scenarios and verify I should have no taxable event for a backdoor Roth conversion but it keeps coming up saying half or all of my contributions are non-taxed. But that makes no sense.

**BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT**

In a scenario beginning with an empty T-IRA with $0, adding $6,500 in **only** non-deductible post-tax contributions, then running a backdoor Roth conversion, results in Form 8606 saying all $6,500 is pre-tax dollars. Huh??

**SCENARIO**

- Gross: Over $170k (haven't actually filed yet, running scenarios, but my MAGI goes above Roth IRA cutoff limits)
- Plan: Create T-IRA account with zero money in it. No contributions. Contribute 6500 non-deductible, then immediately trigger Roth conversion to report on 2024 tax return next year.

I'll also do this for 2023 now before April 15th, but the 2023 scenario shows 0 tax, my question here is looking ahead in 2024 to understand what could happen tax-wise. (assuming no changes to the law)

**WHAT I GET FROM FORM 8606**

- Line 1: 6500 total **non-deductible post-tax contributions**
- Line 2: 0 basis because only my non-deductible contribution went in
- Line 3: 6500, Yes (Roth conversion)
- Line 4: 0 contributions made Jan-Apr 2025 (again, future scenario)
- Line 5: 6500 (line 3 - line 4)
- Line 6: 0 (assuming Roth conversion prior to 31 Dec, this should be zero as all would be in Roth by then)
- Line 7: 0 distributions
- Line 8: 6500 converted to Roth during the year
- Line 9: 6500 (add lines 6+7+8)
- Line 10: 1.0 (line 5 / line 9)
- Line 11: 6500 (line 8 x line 10)
  - ^^ Form 8606 says **This is the nontaxable portion of the amount you converted to Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRAs.** 

### ⁉️ 

How can that be, when the account started at zero and I would only put in 6500 non-deductible (post-tax) dollars?

Thanks for any advice.

(If it matters in any way I also have one small inherited Roth IRA sitting idle, never put in a contribution, never will. I will roll it into my Federal TSP account later.)",2024-03-07 00:29:12,3.0,7.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Questions about W-2 to the IRS,"Hello. I was helping someone I know file their previous years’ taxes because we recently discovered they never actually filed. They tried filing with turbotax, but for some reason the returns never got sent. But that’s an issue for another day.

The problem now is when we were reviewing their W-2s, we found out that their employer possibly never sent the W-2s to the IRS because they are not on on their ID.me account. Their other W-2s are there, so it’s only this specific employer. These are for 2021 and 2022.

My question is, do all W-2s sent to the IRS show up on your account, or could there be exceptions like this one? Or is the employer doing something illegal? If so, will my friend get in trouble? They were not aware of this.

Reddit,Accountable,"Someone used my SSN as received a large refund. Currently waiting for a tax investigation, but what is my outlook?","As the title states, someone used my SSN and received a large refund. To provide a general timeline, I waited until the last day (filing in CA so we got an extension due to storms - 10/13/24) to file taxes because we owed money. When I tried to file on Turbotax, it gave me an error stating that someone else had used my SSN to file taxes.

I looked for answers online and found that most people have said to paper file it by mail so I did along with a cashiers check for what I owed (which was a lot). Then I got a CP53A letter on 11/13/23 letting us know that they tried to direct deposit a refund, but it couldn't be process which was a red flag. On 11/29/23, we got the LTR5747C letting me know that they received a tax return under my name and SSN. I called the IRS and they let me know that it was because there were 2 returns filed for the year 2022 so I made an appt to go into the IRS office. On 12/13/23, I show up with all my documentation for the agent to let me know that someone had filed a tax return using my information and received a LARGE refund. I filed a form 14039 (tax fraud affidavit) with the agent on the spot, but he let me know that it may take over a year to find a resolution for the investigation. On 1/2/24, I received a bill from the IRS for the amount that was refunded to the other person who committed tax fraud which is building interest. After talking with an agent, she let me know that it wont be sent to collections until the case is resolved, but it could take awhile as it still hasn't been assigned to an investigator.

The steps I've taken so far are creating a credit block/freeze with all 3 major credit bureaus, filing a tax fraud report through FTC and a tax fraud affidavit with the IRS. For anyone who has gone through this experience, what are the chances that I am found innocent and I do not have to owe anything? It is a pretty hefty bill and I am scared/nervous/upset.

Hopefully that gets resolved and I can mail an updated tax return later. FYI, I have a family member who is an accountant and received this email:

""The GAO observed a steady increase in return processing errors in recent years, with an internal IRS error identification system showing that overall errors rose from 12.6 percent in 2020 to 15.5 percent in 2023. One review in that system covers new hires and staff in training, and despite a reduction in processing errors among this cohort from 2022 to 2023, their overall defect rate was still higher than the submission processing average.

The GAO attributed part of the new hires’ generally high error rate to the IRS’s big hiring push in its submission processing function in 2022 and beyond, though the watchdog noted that the defect rate was already rising before then.""",2024-01-09 00:38:29,2.0,11.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,How to prevent California from classifying 1099 freelance consultant as an employee,"Hello!

I'm a freelance (1099) tech consultant in California. I have one primary client that accounts for 95% of my income. I've reviewed the A-B-C test criteria that CA established under Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5) to distinguish independent contractors versus employees, and I'm fairly certain that I can pass all 3 standards, but i've recently been told by my client that they are hearing from their accountant/lawyer that CA is starting to match up freelance worker's SSN with the 1099s to identify and target businesses who may be in violation of the A-B-C standards. 

What can I do to strengthen my 1099 status and minimize the chances of my client being investigated (and possibly fined) for violating AB5? I've been operating as a sole proprietor for many years, but would it help to form an LLC at this point to create more of a business-to-business relationship? Or can I just apply for an EIN as a sole proprietor? Perhaps a new contract that explicitly states that I am not an employee but an independent contractor performing work that the company does not have internal staff capable of performing? 

And is there anything I can do at this point when filing my taxes for 2023 that I can retroactively use to help create more separation between my client and myself? (e.g. If I form an LLC or get an EIN now can I use that for my 2023 tax filing?",2024-02-26 21:12:22,2.0,7.0,tax,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,HSA treatment and correcting a CPA,"First time using a CPA and happy to pay because 1116, 8938, FBAR etc make my eyes glaze over and all of it is way above my IQ/paygrade etc and - more important - same folks (CPA and tax attorney) will handle a streamlined domestic procedure later this year. 

I am reviewing the prelim from the CPA before filing and I notice that HSA interest, dividends and a capital gain (sold investment account stock to cash before utilizing a trustee to trustee transfer) are included on my 1040. 

Question 1)
Am I correct that these should NOT be part of the 1040 filing?

I also notice that the form 1116 line 3d is the total dividend amount including domestic dividends. It is pulled from a Vanguard 1099-DIV form line 1a which has domestic mutual funds and money markets included. To get the actual foreign number there is a percentage I can use from the 1099-CONS form that Vanguard issues to calculate the qualified and the ordinary FOREIGN dividend amount that this one particular VEU ETF has kicked out. 

So I will be contacting the CPA with my comments and ask if it needs to be adjusted. 

I’m not judging the CPA or questioning if this has been sloppy or merely not understanding my data. I’m a new client for the CPA and got accepted recently and I know it is crunch time. It is the first time these folks have seen my data, forms and other files. Full on benefit of the doubt. 

Question 2)
For you tax pros: My question is if clients point out mistakes or adjustments often? Assume best way is to just state my comments matter of fact (knowing that I’m not the expert here and trying to not be ‘that guy’)

Reddit,Accountable,Roth 401(k) Accidentally Rolled into Traditional Rollover IRA,"     Apologies for the length, just really stuck and wanted to include the relevant info. Back in February of 2023, I rolled over $20,000 from a previous company's Roth 401(k) into a Traditional Rollover IRA with Fidelity. This should not have been possible - transferring between different types of tax advantaged accounts like this is illegal. However, at the time, I was not aware that the rollover IRA was traditional (silly, I know), there were no controls to prevent it, and I only just realized when I started doing my taxes this year. In the time the money has been in the account, it has accrued an additional ~$1000 of earnings.

     After contacting Fidelity several times, each person gave me different instructions. They were, in order:
     1.   Complete an IRA recharacterization form. However, that does not apply to a rollover contribution like this, so it wouldn't process. So I called Fidelity again.
     2.   Perform a roth conversion, but that is not possible because the initial rollover was illegal since it went from Roth to traditional. So they transferred me to a new rep
     3.   The new rep told me to contact a tax accountant and do as they instruct. After calling a tax accountant I was informed that this should be able to be fixed by Fidelity since my 2023 taxes have not yet been submitted. So I called Fidelity again
     4.   This time, Fidelity said that due to the rollover happening ~1 year ago, the only thing that could be done is to complete a Return of Excess, have the funds sent back to me, then complete a Certification for Late Rollover Contribution. This would create a taxable event that would need to be reported on my 2024 taxes

     After reviewing the return of excess form, it didn't really seem to be appropriate for my situation since it's not really an excess contribution.  Additionally, I don't know what the actual financial implications of this being a taxable event are, so I don't know what to expect.

Here is how it is described on their website linked below:

**The Payroll Verification & Cash Flow Report is the kind of tenant screening you have always hoped to see. Renters don’t pay their rent with their credit (most of the time) and hardly ever are their rent payments reported to the credit bureau. Our Payroll Verification & Cash Flow Report will reveal the ability to pay your rent by examining the last three months of their banking history.**

**The bank balance on the report will reveal the cash balance maintained in the applicant’s bank account(s) along with cash flows so you can judge if your applicant can afford your rent. The report will provide you with detailed deposits so you can verify employment and monthly income. This is a perfect report for a tenant who doesn’t have any credit history or if you are on the fence about whether you should rent to him or not.**

**LeaseRunner utilizes an “Instant Account Verification” process where LeaseRunner is authorized by the prospective renter to obtain read-only data from the renter’s bank account. The authorization form requires the applicant to enter his online banking credentials confirming the identity of the applicant with his bank. The bank account data is returned instantaneously and formatted into an easy-to-read cash flow report.**

Reddit,Accountable,Should we sell our house that we just purchased?,"Throwaway account.

My wife and I just bought a house (our first) four months ago. We were renting the house for about 5 years and the owner made us a deal to purchase the house for their remaining mortgage amount. We bought the house for $168,000 and it appraised for $245,000. I believe, with some touching up, it could sell for closer to $260,000 based on similar houses that sold on the same street/neighborhood. The house is approximately 15 years old.

I am the sole income provider and made ~$52k last year... we are struggling to make the payments. In fact, we aren't making the payments really. We had $10k in savings and are now down to $6k. My monthly payment is $1500 and that includes insurance and property tax. Our intrest rate is 5.8% and this is our only debt.

I should be getting another raise in the next few weeks (annual review) but I know better than to count on that. I'm also hoping the intrest rates improve but know I can't count on that either. My wife will likely return work next year part time but that wont be until our youngest child starts school.

Our budget shows on paper that we could tighten our belts and potentially be in the black $100 a month. I feel like that is cutting it too close. My gut is telling me that I should list the house for sale January (6 months into our mortgage) and find an older/cheaper home. Realistically we could find another home for $140,000-$160,000, use the money from the sale to make the downpayment and have a significant chunk of change leftover. I'm hesitant for a few reasons: we both really like the area we are in now, I've never done anything like this before (usually pay cash for my vehicles), and I'm not sure how taxes/capital gains would work. Someone, not a reliable source, said we wouldn't pay a capital gains tax because of our income. We are in Mississippi.

We should have $2000-$4000 back on our tax return and I have an older extra vehicle I could sell for $3,000 if I had to. I'm trying not to rely on either of those as capital but in my mind those are extra house payments I could use in an emergency. Another point, potentially, is after selling this house and getting into another one I could use the leftover cash to jump start my retirement. I'm currently 34 and have nothing except my savings listed above.

I hope that is enough information and that it all makes sense. I kind of layed awake last night in a panic after we went over our budget. This post was made entirely with stress as its main motivation.

Thank you for any advice.


Edit - I definitely appreciate all of the responses even if I didn't respond directly I'd like to thank all of you. We do have two small children, this is the oldest first year in school and the youngest starts next year. It was cheaper for my wife to stay home than to pay childcare for two young children. Than plan was always for her to return to work when the youngest started school and we are going to try and accelerate that. 

We are going to go through our budget more thoroughly and try and make this house work. Thank you.",2024-12-02 21:15:10,336.0,225.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,"Review of Multiple Tax Advantaged Account Strategy (401Ks, IRA)","All,

I (28) am in the process of cleaning up and refining my financial strategy, starting with my tax advantaged accounts.

**Current breakdown:**

* Traditional 401K with previous employer: $21K
* Roth 401K with current employer: $96K. I'm currently maxing this out at $23K/yr; employer contributes additional $5K/yr.
* Roth IRA - $20K balance (can not contribute further the ""front door"" way due to income)

**Proposed plan:**

* Start backdoor Roth IRA contributions by setting up traditional IRA account
* Roll Traditional 401K into current employer (allows for both trad or roth 401Ks). Planning on doing this instead of rolling into traditional IRA to avoid pro-rata tax conversion on backdoor contributions.
* Shift current 401K into traditional 401K (advice needed here, current marginal tax bracket is at the top range of 24%, with my husband and I bringing in around $370K annually)

Does this seem appropriate? Any other advice on how to best approach? For context, outside of this I have $140K in a taxable brokerage account and $110K in a HYSA. Tackling those next.

Thanks in advance!",2024-06-25 21:19:08,1.0,4.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Restaurant double charged us and hasn’t refunded it,"I went to visit my sister recently and we went to a restaurant. I paid for the meal for almost $150 and my debit card “declined” so my sister paid for it in full.

I checked my bank account and it said the payment went through so we spoke to a manager and they insisted the charge would drop off within 48 hours.

48 hours later, the charge posted. I waited a couple of days just in case and then I called the restaurant and told them the charge didn’t drop off. They said they’ll give me a refund and gave me a refund E-receipt with the word “VOIDED” at the top of it. I asked them about it and they said that means they voided the original transaction (weird because it already posted).

I waited a week and the original transaction was still there and no refund. I called the restaurant back and they were pretty rude about it and said they gave me a refund and it’s my “bank’s problem” if I didn’t receive it.

I waited another day just in case and then called my bank this morning. They have no record of a refund or the charge being reversed at all. They said it shouldn’t have taken more than 3 business days and it’s been like 12 days at this point.

Is it time for me to dispute this through my bank? They said it could take up to 90 days.

I read the reviews for the restaurant and they have multiple reviews saying they over tip themselves and steal money from customers 😵‍💫 is there anyone else I should report this to?

Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented! I’m disputing it through my bank and they gave me a temporary credit while they investigate it. And I will use my credit card instead of my debit card from now on!",2024-07-02 19:05:41,642.0,157.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Forbes review of TD Ameritrade cash management account - huh?,"I'm trying to simplify my finances, and as part of that I am considering a cash management account. I started searching and a Forbes article quickly turned up: ""[5 Best Cash Management Accounts Of March 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/best-cash-management-accounts/)"" (with a timestamp ""Updated: Feb 1, 2024, 2:35pm""). In their list, they include Fidelty, Aspiration, TD Ameritrade, Betterment and Wealthfront (but not Schwab). 

The Forbes site also has ""[TD Ameritrade Cash Management Account Review 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/td-ameritrade-cash-management-account-review/)"" with a timestamp ""Updated: Jan 5, 2024, 8:25am"". The article says ""Account details and annual percentage yields (APYs) are accurate as of Jan. 18, 2023."" - not a good sign for timeliness.

But Schwab bought Ameritrade last year. If I go to tdameritrade.com, it says to open a Schwab account. Are the editors and fact checkers at Forbes not aware of this? I left feedback on the Forbes site, maybe they will update things.

Anyway, at this point I'm pretty much down to moving everything to Schwab or to Fidelity. ",2024-03-02 00:36:21,0.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,"IRS thinks they owe me $14k, I disagree.","tldr: I am holding a check from the IRS for $14k that I don't think they owe me and I'm not sure what to do about it.

Backstory: I used to do consulting work (1099) on the side of my normal (W-2) job and have used a CPA to prepare my tax returns for years, but when I got married in 2021 we used the person my wife had been using instead of my normal person to prepare our FY2021 return (married, filing jointly). When we got the initial copy of our return back, I reviewed it and found nothing wrong except that in the section where we list my consulting work (Schedule C) it listed my wife as the proprietor along with her social. I requested that they correct this to my name and social, but didn't immediately get a corrected return from them. As the April due date was approaching, I reached out several times requesting the corrected return so we could sign the e-file consent, but still got no response. It got to be a couple days before the due date and I didn't know what to do, but I figured changing the name and social on that form wasn't going to impact anything else about the return, certainly not the amount owed (right?), so I decided to send a payment off to the IRS for what the original return said I owed, which was approx. $13k (I will use approximate numbers as I don't think the exact numbers are pertinent to the question). Turns out the CPA had filed for an extension and didn't actually get around to making the change until closer to August of 2022. When they sent over the corrected return, however, it showed us only owing $12k. This return was e-filed, and then things got....weird.

First, the IRS sent us a letter saying we owed them $12k despite having already payed them $13k. Logging into my account on the IRS website clearly showed my over-payment, but it didn't indicate it was for 2021 taxes (might have been my mistake when paying, maybe because we just got married and were filing jointly and I might not have indicated that correctly....not sure). It took some back and forth between our CPA and the IRS, but the IRS eventually acknowledged the payment and sent us the $1k difference as a refund (plus a little interest, score!). Figured that was that, until we got a letter earlier this month from the IRS, this time saying their records show they owe us $13k for over-payment of our 2021 taxes. Shortly after, a check arrived in the mail from them for $14k; the original $13k plus interest!

I have done everything I can think of to figure out why the IRS thinks they owe us this money. I checked my account on the IRS website again and it only shows a single payment of $13k back in 2022 (plus later payments for 2022 taxes, but those were MUCH less, so I don't think those are causing any issue). On the contrary, it says I owe $0 and makes no mention of them owing me anything. I have checked my and my wife's bank statements and haven't found any additional payments. I even confirmed she deposited the $1k check they sent as a refund. As far as I can tell, they don't owe me any money, but I'll be honest: neither me nor my wife are the most diligent people when it comes to keeping track of finances and I can't say I'm absolutely positive we checked every place the money could have come from. And after all, would the IRS really be so incompetent as to send us such a large check without being sure they owed us this money?

As far as I can tell, my options are:

1. Trust the IRS and deposit the money, let it earn interest and see if they ever ask for it back (might I have to pay a penalty for this?).
2. Trust my own (admittedly lacking) accounting and shred the check, hoping that if they really DO owe us this money they'll send another one
3. Spend my days trying to contact someone at the IRS to get them to confirm for me whether they sent this check in error, and THEN deposit or shred it accordingly.

I turn to you, beloved Reddit community, to see if you have advice for how to handle this. Honestly, it seems like trying to contact the IRS is the only real option here, but I don't know how to do that in a way that isn't going to waste multiple hours over multiple days before I can maaaaybe get someone to help me. Plus, I have an infant at home, so honestly, anything that requires significant effort on my part is likely not going to happen anytime soon. We have since abandoned the CPA that filed our 2021 return and see no reason why they would help with this issue. I could ask my current CPA to do it, but she's likely to bill me hourly for the time she spends on this, and something about spending money to determine that the IRS doesn't owe me this money just feels like getting dumped by your SO over dinner and then being asked to pick up the tab. Thoughts?

Edit: Gotten some great advice already and will be returning the check ([https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc161](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc161)) and will try calling the IRS, otherwise will reach out to the Taxpayer Advocate Service.

Reddit,Accountable,Seemingly always digging a deeper hole with no way out - advice? ,"Hi there! 

I'm a newb to this community, so please forgive me if I am asking redundant questions. However, I think everyone's situation is a bit different. 

Here's my family's scenario:

- family of 4 (me, my husband, and his 2 kiddos - a 16 year old girl and 18 year old boy that is on the autism spectrum).

- I have numerous chronic health conditions that prevent me from working outside the home because each day and level of pain is different. I have filed for SSI disability in April 2023 and now I'm the queue to be processed, but my state has an average wait time of 18-24 months, routine denials and appeals, and an 86-90% denial rate. Nearly every case has to be brought before a judge for a decision - and that can take up to 3-5 years, depending on workload.

To keep my mind occupied, I went back to school to earn my bachelor's of fine arts in graphic design online. Vocational Rehabilitation covers the costs of books, tuition, supplies, materials, tuition, internet, and fuel mileage to/from all medical appointments, as well as my health insurance premium each month. While there is a LOT of paperwork and red tape to deal with using VR, I cannot complain because they have provided me EVERYTHING I need to be successful - even new MacBook pros, iPad Pro, cloud storage, software.... The list goes on. 

- My husband works as a automotive technician in a new car dealership about 35 minutes each way from home. He has been in the industry for over 25 years. His current employer and direct manager seem to be decent to work with and he likes this job so much better than the last.

HOWEVER, when he started at this current job one year ago this past February, he hired on at $25/hour with the lromoiof a review in 90 days and the possibility of raise if he produced quality, profitable work with little to no customer comebacks (customer complaints). My husband has excelled at this job because he is the most experienced in this shop of 25-30 lifts, besides the senior mainline master  mechanic. He received his raise of $1/he by June 1, 2023, placing him at $26/hr. 

But, about two months ago, his manager approached him about possibly becoming the shop foreman - watching over the other mechanics, assisting them with tasks they are not fluent or efficient with, and generally coaching the team towards better and fast completion rates, upsells, and general increase in their skill set/knowledge. 

One would think that this was an opportunity to move up - it is a supervisory position that comes with added responsibility, extra accountability, becoming lead trainer for new employees, and less time of my husband working on his own lift - and that it would come with a raise. Bot no. I'm baffled at the arrangement because he went from $26/hr to $15/he and then he makes 50¢ off of every hour the other mechanics he supervises, bills out. For example, just for my husband being at the shop from 8-5, he will make $120/day base pay. If the 4 techs under him can bill 8 hr/day each, that is a total of 32 hours x 50¢ - or $16/day in commission. That's roughly at $680/week gross paycheck. By the time taxes, insurance, retirement, etc are deducted, he might come home with a $500/week paycheck. 

Before this change in position, as a regular automotive tech, he could easily flag 38-45 hrs/week at $26hr = $1092 gross/week (based on 42 hours/week) - an average of nearly $700-725/week net.

That is a loss of about $800 per month (about $200 per week).

I should also mention that if he and his team can meet monthly quotas for upsells and accuracy percentages, he is eligible for a $500/month bonus (averages out to $125/week). Even with the monthly bonus he is still making less now than he was, though he will not listen to me. He's such a pushover when it comes to working and helping others - easily taken advantage of, maybe because when he's the martyr, he's getting that attention, praise, and ""atta boy"" that he secretly ut desperately craves. 

Otherwise, logically and mathematically, I can't make sense of the numbers. 

My husband the sole income earned for our household. Since my stepson turned 18 and is considered a legal adult (although realistically, he's 12 years old mentally and emotionally), the SSA cut his monthly disability benefits. We are currently awaiting a new case manager to assist in helping him regain those benefits and add any other possible benefits for him. 

Needless to say, our expenses each month surpass the monthly income, leaving us to bridge the gap with credit cards, and at times (against my will or consent) payday loans. I hate payday loans because the APR is 299.00% compounding. Each week, the payday loan company automatically takes half of my husband's paycheck to make that payment. 

We live in a 714 sq ft, 3 br/1 ba early 1900s bungalow with a basement. Since we rent the house, we are responsible for all utilities, trash, and yard maintenance. 

Here's our monthly breakdown;

Water/electric: ~$200.00

Natural Gas: ~60.00

Rent: $350.00 (our portion as my parents help us with the remaining $400 each month)

Groceries: ~$150.00/week

Fuel for my husband (commutes about 400 miles/week): $400.00

Fuel for my vehicle (mostly reimbursed by VR): $250.00

Streaming services (we do not have cable or satellite TV) ~$75.00

Monthly vehicle maintenance: ~$25/mo unless an emergency repair pops up

Vehicle insurance: ~$170.00

Household insurance (renter's insurance) ~$30.00

CCLI insurance for my husband and me: ~$30.00

Vehicle extended warranty/service plan (husband's vehicle): $150.00

2 vehicle loan payments: $1,276.00

Internet service (reimbursed by VR): $89.99

Health insurance premium (me only): ~$70.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Credit card payments: ~$1,050.00 (~$40,000 credit card debt + accruing interest averaging 25%)

Payday Loan: ~350.00 (+200.00% APR - original loan amount was $1,350.00 - current balance with interest as of today - $1,754.13, even after $675.00 in payments so far)

Monthly subscriptions used for school (cloud storage, reference sites, stock art, etc.):  ~$80.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Medical bill payments: ~30.00

Trash service: $60.50 every 3 months (~$20.17/mo)

Cell phone service: ~$200.00 for 2 lines and phones 

Husband insists on eating out every day at lunch during the week: $400.00

Entertainment/Dining Out together: ~$250.00

Pet care/supplies/food: $175 every 6 weeks

--------
Total monthly outflow: ~$6,000-7,000

Husband's income: ~$2,400.00
Monthly Bonus (if earned): $500.00
Monthly VR reimbursement: ~$740.00
Pet sitting side hustle (not reliable or steady) - Average of ~$60/mo +/-

TOTAL INCOME: ~$3,860.00

Overbudget: ~ $2140.00-3140.00

This is a crisis. 

I know the credit card debit, vehicle payments, payday loan and the cut in my husband's salary, and my physical inability to work because of my health are the pain points. However I am overwhelmed and at a loss as to how to even make and balance a budget with this much disparagement. 

I've thought about making an appointment with either financial planner or debt counselor to see if they can help me work out a plan. My state offers a free service for debt counseling. I met with them once and their only solution was bankruptcy, which I couldn't even afford to pay for. 

We are in our mid-to-lats 40s and really do not want to do bankruptcy as we have a dream to build a home on part of my parent's acreage in the country. Currently, our credit scores are around the 615-625 mark and we are utilizing 51-56% of our credit (keeping the credit score low due to the debt ratio).

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone have any legitimate suggestions or resources to make a plan and then this situation around? I am sick of the daily stress. DCF claims that we make too much each month - the calculate off of the gross income, although no one lives off their gross income - so we are not eligible for SNAP or LIHEAP (utility assistance program) assistance.

My husband refuses to discuss our finances - I think mostly because he knows we're in so deep and it feels like the weight of it is all on his shoulders, that he's not doing s good enough job, etc. He does like to bury and avoid issues. So frustrating. 

Any logistical help would be appreciated - resources, software for planning, etc 

Thank you. :)",2024-07-25 14:17:34,146.0,131.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,Can I find health insurance for less than $200/month?,"  
New Account for Privacy.  
  
25M, single (no family) living in Queens, New York. Prior to college graduation I was under Medicaid. Currently, I make about $85,000 after bonus yearly at this job.

The company I work for provides 3 different levels of health insurance (dental/vision are separate). Basic ($30), Plus ($55), and Premium ($95) for individual only bi-weekly (pay period).

I have had a tumor in the past (benign, thank God) and although I am fine now I do have extensive care going forward including 3x medication (2 pill and 1 injection) and an annual to bi-annual ""specialist visits"" ($40 copay under Prem. in-network).

I haven't had the need to visit the emergency room in 7 or so years, and hopefully ill never have to.

There is a $10 copay for each med.

Considering my medical history, I am planning on opting in for the premium health insurance.

From the reviews that I have read online, the insurance provider that my company uses, UMR, is not very recommended. I understand UMR is under United Health Care and that reviews aren't the be-all end-all

I take my health very serious, and would be open to pay more money for the peace of mind of a better health insurance company.

I know that NY has a marketplace for insurance, but am considering going to an insurance broker to better navigate this situation.

Reddit,Accountable,"I have 22k in credit card debt and 21k in pandemic stocks. Should I knock out the debt to have a ""clean slate"" or work to keep the stocks (credit may be hit due to partial payments)?","I (28F) have been poor with my finances and had several hits this year (new car, sick family member). At the moment I have 22k in credit card debt, about 13k needs to be paid off by March 14.

I have about 14k in my checking & savings accounts right now and a 21k stock portfolio. I have ***never*** missed at least paying my last balance on my cards (credit score has been at 730-750).

Looking at my stocks, I'd have to sell my winners, which would be 80% of my portfolio (which adds up to 17k) and the losers (3k). To not cash out the stock I've thought about searching for a credit card with 0% APR for balance transfers for 6< months but am concerned about the credit pull--I opened a credit card and got a car loan just this fall.

Is this the circumstances when you choose to sell stocks (they're all long term)? A part of me already sees the relief of selling the winning stocks to just have more cash around and leaving the losers (stocks that are at least 50% down).

Question: Is it better to shuffle debt around, or sell the whole portfolio and take this as a ""clean slate"" opportunity?

edit: This is the balances and APR rates; and stocks! Sorry for being unclear--I don't have a 0% APR credit card, but I was considering the worth of applying to one to then transfer the credit.

Reddit,Accountable,How can I be sure my mother isn't falling prey to a financial scam?,"My mother has had an account worth nearly a million dollars at an investment firm for about five years. Over the years I've been on conference calls with her and her financial advisor (recommended to us by her sister, who has been with him for nearly twenty years) and until recently I thought her money was safely growing there.

Three days ago, she texted me to tell me that she was firing him because ""we can do better elsewhere."" She is absolutely furious with him and the account's rate of return. I don't have access to the account and so I can't speak to how badly the account has been underperforming, but I was taken aback by how uncharacteristically angry my mother was and still is with him and his firm and I'm afraid intense emotions may be clouding her judgment.

So when she told me she'd already decided what she wants to do with her money, I was immediately suspicious. From what I've been able to piece together, about three weeks ago she reached out to a small, independent financial company a 5 hours' drive away from her home in a neighboring state and is totally convinced that this avenue is the best way forward for her money. She sent me a link to the website - I was deeply unimpressed, and the site looks to be more style than substance, but I thought in spite of everything there was a chance it could be an honest enterprise.

I find it a little concerning, though, that the proprietor of that business drove with his family all the way to my mother's town yesterday and attended church with her today before calling me to discuss his business with the three of us. Isn't it nice they decided to devote a whole weekend to this one potential client? Maybe he really is just that wholesome and magnanimous, but I have to assume for my mother's safety that he's either going the extra mile just to lock down a substantial commission with a sizeable account, OR he's a shameless con man about to fleece her.

My mother is bent on getting her funds away from our current broker as quickly as possible - maybe for good reason, but I don't believe in making hasty and emotional decisions with this amount of money, and I would prefer to explore several options before making any decisions. Right now, though, my main concern is making sure that this man is at least legitimate. From what they tell me, the plan is simply to open an annuity account at Nationwide - this independent guy isn't directly affiliated with Nationwide, but collects some sort of referral fee. And he stressed repeatedly that neither he nor his company is ever in direct contact with her funds.

However, there were two things that worried me in our conversation today. The first is that, when I questioned why there was such an urgent need to move the account as soon as possible, he suggested that ""anything could happen"" if my mother keeps her money where it's at. He claims he hasn't been badmouthing our current financial advisor, but implying that our current firm could do irreversible damage in the next few weeks if we don't sign IMMEDIATELY is absolutely ridiculous. And the biggest red flag for me was that, when I said that we ought to have our lawyer double check whatever documents he's going to present my mother, he called that a ""waste of money."" Exact words!

I called my mother later, in private, and she did agree to run things by our lawyer first, for whatever that's worth. I'm no expert, but my gut tells me something doesn't feel right here. I plan to call Nationwide first thing in the morning and find out if they've had dealings with this man or his company before. **What other due diligence should I be doing right now?**

EDIT: **Is BBB accreditation worth anything?** I found the company on the BBB website. According to their records, they have been in business for one year and accredited with the BBB for almost three months with an A- rating, but there isn't a lot of information about it otherwise. They also have about a dozen positive reviews on Google, most of which are a year or more old but also few from the past few months and weeks. If it was a restaurant I would think twice about eating there, but I'm not the one making the decisions here, unfortunately

EDIT #2: Calling Nationwide directly didn't do me any good - all they can tell me, apparently, is that most people who use their services come to them directly. I called the insurance department for his state. According to them, he is licensed, but they couldn't find a license for his LLC. I called him to request the licensing number for his LLC, and he told me that his LLC is not licensed because, since he himself is licensed, there is no need. He claimed he was an ""open book"" and that I could ask him anything about his ""personal history, military history, and belief in God."" I then asked him if he was a fiduciary. He claimed to be, but would not tell me his CRD number and I cannot find any record of him at the national database: [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)  He became irritated and told me he was only going to communicate with my mother going forward.",2024-09-23 04:24:52,48.0,68.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,"Amazon drastically changed my RSU grants, basically cutting my pay by more than half. I’m a bit in shock and not sure how to plan for such a reduction in pay.","Throw away account, but I work as an engineer at Amazon and the majority of my compensation has always come in stock.

I had always gotten a raise in my base pay around March or April every year, even if it was only a small cost of living amount, and I always received additional stock grants at the same time. 

Currently that’s meant a ~$180K base pay + $50K bonus + 1440 RSUs (~$255K) = $485K annual comp 

The last two years, I asked for a more significant raise in my base pay, they said I couldn’t get my base raised more, but they approved a $50K bonus (to be paid over 6 pay cycles aka 3 months)… so my base pay has remained at $180K… around $4K per paycheck after tax.

So this year, I went on maternity leave in March, a few weeks before these annual compensation increases tend to happen. My manager said we could have my comp discussion whenever I felt recovered.  On my performance review I received the highest possible marks, including an award each manger is only able to give to one person on their entire team.  I expected a good raise or even promotion.

I had been pestering him for 2+ months to find out my new comp.  Now it’s June and I finally found out from him that (1) I won’t be getting any raise in 2024 (2) the $50K bonus I received the past 2 years will not be happening at all this year and (3) I went from previously receiving 1440 shares/year to only 190 in 2025!! (in addition to a past grant of 450), then only 300 total in 2026!!! That’s an 80% reduction in RSUs.

Assuming the stock price stays flat, that means my pay over the past few years will go from $485K down to $435K in 2024 down to $293K in 2025 down to $232K in 2026.

My manager cited the “significant rise in stock price since last year” as the likely reason, but he also admitted that he didn’t really understand it fully.  Basically saying that because the stock rose so much, they’re now accidentally paying people too much.  But that’s the exact risk I took by taking RSUs instead of cash!  Thing is, yes, the stock is up 70%+ since last year, but (1) since I was hired in 2020 the stock is actually nearly flat!  (2) stock growing 2x in a year shouldn’t warrant reducing the stock to 1/5th of the previous grants (3) they never issued me more shares when the stock dipped and (4) there’s no saying it won’t dip again. 

Regardless the reason, I’ll be making less than half of what I currently make.

There’s also this general undertone of “it’s tough in tech right now, you’re all lucky to be employed at all”, but also…. I can’t help but wonder if I’m being silently penalized for having a baby and being out of work for 6 months.

I understand this sub likely has a wide variety of income levels and I’m not expecting sympathy for making $235K/yr, but it’s just so drastically different than I feel I’m either being targeting for getting pregnant or they think im stupid and won’t understand how much less I’ll be making.

Has anyone gone through something similar with FAANG jobs? How do you plan your finances knowing you’re going to be making less?",2024-06-03 04:23:58,0.0,73.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,"fraudulent charge, how I get my money back from Chase","On 02/05/2024, I noticed there is wire transfer $32,000 in my Chase saving account. I immediately went to Chase local branch to report it. Chase employee told me someone with my fake drive license did this in a branch 2 hours away from my location after making a few calls. The reason they know the ID is fake because that ID is from a state that I have never been.  
Chase employee connected me with  Chase wire department and Chase claim department. Chase wire department only told me the money has been sent and no guarantee they can reverse it, and gave me a case number. Chase claim department asked me  several questions such as whether I disclose my bank account information, whether I lost my debit card, etc. I spent almost 3 hours with them but later it turns out these time are completely wasted. The only thing matters is when I asked the safety of the rest money in my checking and saving account, the local Chase employee told me to freeze the saving account. And his manager came and asked to close checking account because someone just initiated another wire transfer in checking account and the local Chase employee stopped it. After that I was told to wait for further news from Chase.  
While waiting in the bank, I did ask whether Chase can reimburse me, the only reply is to wait for investigation even Chase local employee already told me this is unauthorized wire transfer.   
On 02/06/2024, I went to local police station to report it. Clearly, police doesn't plan to do any further investigation even someone did this in person in a Chase branch.  
On 02/12/2024 9:30 pm around, Chase sent me a secure message saying they fail to recall my money and asked me to contact recipient to request my money back (how ridiculous!) and thereby the case is closed. I was pissed off and immediately file a CFPB claim to state this situation and how irresponsible Chase is.  
On 02/13/2024 9:30 pm around, I received another secure message from Chase saying I should go to local branch or contact claim department.  
On 02/14/2024, I went to Chase local branch and was connected with Chase claim department who requested a copy of my drive license and proof of me being at work.  
From 02/15/2024 to 02/21/2024, I faxed those documents multiple times even through Chase local branch. But Chase claim department keep saying they don't received my documents. Eventually one manage from claim department apologized and admitted it is their fault that they don't receive my document, and requested another attempt, which was also done through Chase local branch.   
Meanwhile, On 02/16/2024, I received a phone call from Chase executive office and said they open the case and will get back to me before 02/28/2024.  
Then on 02/28/2024, CFPB received the response from Chase, the final letter said the recipient refuse to return the money and they don't receive the document requested. They cannot credit my account and the case is closed. I contacted executive office and was suggested sending office the document directly with case number. And I leave a message to the person in charge of my case expecting an explanation why my case is closed without any solution.  
On 03/01/2024, the person in charge of my case from executive office called me, basically saying the case is closed, leave executive office out of it, contact claim department yourself. How irresponsible!  
Same day, I called claim department and finally they said they receive my document and need 5 days or less to investigate. And this is another nightmare.   
On 03/07/2024, I called to check status and a person in charge of my case saying it takes 5 days to review my document (just DL) and it takes 45 to 90 days to recall domestic wire transfer. I was completely speechless.  
One 03/11/2024, I called again and this time I was told 5 days means the end of that day, I know it is completely wrong but didn't argue. And when I asked when I can get the investigation result, she told me Chase can spend as many days as needed to investigate, no timeline of investigation and getting my money back.  
I was completely irritated by her ignorance and indifference. But I didn't waste time arguing with her. I immediately file another CFPB claim saying Chase is violation of CFR Part 1005 (Regulation E) § 1005.11 Procedures for resolving errors (c) Time limits and extent of investigation, which I found in CFPB website.  
Meanwhile, I calm myself down and was considering lawsuit/arbitration/public media as my next resort.  
On 03/14/2024, I got Chase reply from CFPB saying   
We appreciate you taking the time to tell us about our service. Your feedback helps us serve you better.  We aim to give exceptional service and are sorry if we did not meet this goal when you contacted us.  We received the requested copy of your identification on February 29, 2024. We also received additional documents from you on March 8.  We reviewed the provided information, and approved your claim. We credited $32,000 to your account ending in 3883 on March 14, and  also refunded the Domestic Wire Fee for $35. Please allow one business day for the funds to post to your account.  The security of your information is important to us, and we apologize for any inconvenience this matter may have caused you.   
This is the only time that they officially apologize for my suffering over more than a month and their fault!  
But on 03/15/2024, I receive a notice letter saying they can reverse the credit if they find any evidence of this transaction authorized. Since this notice letter cannot be directly replied, I wrote feedback in CFPB case and request a clarification on whether Chase can take my money back anytime. No reply so far. I don't think they really care though.  
I write this so that I want readers to know how difficult it can be and how indifferent/irresponsive/ridiculous those people can be.   
If you face a similar situation, calm yourself and be prepared for a long battle. Be insistent, you can get your money back eventually.",2024-03-31 14:32:56,192.0,42.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Security Benefit?!?! I've Been Scammed & I'm Terrified...,"If anyone can help me on what the best steps I can take or has any experience dealing with this please let me know.

  
I am currently freaking out. I made a huge stupid mistake. I am a first year teacher and was contacted by a ""retirement savings"" company that sold me on a 403(b) plan. The company is Security Benefit and I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to sign up with a third party. I got the contract in the mail and it said I have a 10 days from the date of the receipt to return it if I'm not satisfied and the contract will be deemed void from the contract date. The contract date was 11/15/2024 and I received it in the mail either on 11/25/2024 or 11/26/2024 (not exactly sure because I was out of town those days and my grandma checked the mail for me). So do I have 10 days from when I received it in the mail to void this contract or is it too late and I'm fucked?!?!

  
I did research immediately when I received the contract in the mail and everyone is basically saying to run from this company. They have 1 star reviews of people's horrible experience with them. I AM SO SCARED. I feel so fucked. I agreed to putting $256 every paycheck into this fake bullshit 403(b) account. I should have went through SchoolsFirst. Does anyone thing my bank SchoolsFirst will be able to help me at all?! I'm going to contact the company and my bank tomorrow. I'm really hoping I can cancel all of this, I have so much anxiety right now.

  
I was also rereading a document I signed and it says 

  
""I understand and agree to the following: 1. This Salary Reduction Agreement (Agreement) is an agreement between me and my employer that I have entered into voluntarily. 2. This Agreement supersedes and replaces all prior Salary Reduction Agreements. 3. The Agreement is legally binding and irrevocable with respect to amounts paid or available while this agreement is in effect. 4. The Agreement may be terminated or modified at any time for amounts not yet paid or available. 5. Nothing herein shall affect the terms of my employment with the Employer. 6. This Agreement shall automatically terminate if my employment is terminated. 7. SchoolsFirst Plan Administration, LLC charges a third-party administration fee of $2 for each month in which you make a contribution. This fee is paid by your investment provider. Your investment provider may charge the fee against your account directly or indirectly. Contact your investment provider if you have questions about how the fee is handled. I authorize the automatic cancellation of this Salary Reduction Agreement in the event of any of the following: (1) if SchoolsFirst Plan Administration believes additional contributions will cause me to exceed limits under Code Section 415 or 402(g), (2) if receipt of returned contributions due to no account establishment""

  
So if I quit my job this contract with this scamming company will be cancelled right?!?!? I'm really considering doing that if that's my only option. I could reach out to my employer as well and see if they can help me but I'm thinking the worst and I feel extremely fucked. 

  
I know I made a huge stupid ass mistake. Trust me, I feel extremely stupid right now. I'm already having scary thoughts about offing myself if I can't get out of this....

  
If anyone has any helpful information please please please let me know!!!

***EDIT 1***

Thank You everyone that has provided helpful information so far. I’m understanding more and I am much more calm now. I slept on it and realized I shouldn’t be spiraling like that. I’ll be reaching out to both Security Benefits and my employer to terminate the contract. I still don’t want my 403b to be through Security Benefits, but I am very grateful to have some clarity now. If anyone still has any other information I am all ears. Thank you again everyone that has commented on my post. 

***EDIT 2***

Here’s an update if anyone still wants to follow my spiraling journey lol.

I reached out to Security Benefits and they gave me the run around to contact my employer. They did say to mail or fax them something in writing to cancel the account so I definitely will be doing that. Whoever helped me though was extremely helpful and nice and I let them know that. 

I emailed my employer and they basically said I need to contact Schools First as they are the ones that deal with all of this. They also let me know that they receive statements from Schools First monthly about the deductions and since everything was barely processed they have no information about my 403b account currently. 

Finally I call Schools First. They did confirm that my 403b plan with Security Benefits is indeed legit and not a scam of any kind. PHEW that definitely made me feel so much better. Schools First also emailed me that the 403b was confirmed and processed but I don’t know why I thought the email looked weird, luckily the rep confirmed it is a real email and everything is again not a scam. The rep also gave me the information needed to view my 403b account AND adjust the contributions. Immediately I changed it to $0 and it was confirmed. I’m feeling so much better now. The rep also said I have until 12/15 to get all this done and get rid of everything. But luckily I was already able to change my contributions to $0 so even if I don’t cancel in time, no money will be deducted from my paycheck. 

However, I still don’t want this 403b with them because I kept on doing research and the penalties and investments really just don’t seem worth it in the end. A lot of online information was saying 403b is pretty corrupt and an IRA or 457b would be a lot better because of no penalty fees and what not. I’ll continue to do my research and I may just open a plan with Schools First directly since I feel much more comfortable doing it that way. 

I do want to say that in my defense, I was very scared bc of everyone sharing their experience with this specific company. When I said I’m afraid of money I just meant that I’m not as financially literate as I would like to be and it’s hard navigating through all of this because it doesn’t comprehend in my brain very easily. Understanding all of these words and numbers is extremely confusing to me. I don’t know who or what I can trust. Especially with how bad the economy is lately I just want to make sure that I can indeed retire and still live a decent lifestyle. I don’t want to work till I die. I want to be able to own a house one day. I want to not worry about money for once. 

TLDR - Again thank you everyone that read all of this and provided helpful information and tolerated my craziness lol. Truthfully I’ve never spiraled like that before and I apologize for anyone’s convenience. It all gets better from here!",2024-11-27 08:00:40,0.0,25.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Used car purchase. Is it too much car?,"**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the thoughtful and productive discussion. If the crowd saying ""No"" to any and all car purchases would kindly come fix my junker for me, that would be great... 

**Original Post:**

Well my (27M) old, hand-me-down clunker got a ""do not resuscitate"" review from the mechanic. I have never purchased my own car before. After following this subreddit and other money-related subreddits for a few years, I have been scared straight into not buying ""too much car."" Here's where my car search has landed me, with a test drive scheduled for tomorrow afternoon:

**The Car:**

I am looking to purchase a used 2019 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited with 45k miles. Carfax says no accidents, it has had regular maintenance, and it came from Florida (hopefully means no rust). The listed price $22,326, and with estimated tax and fees it's $23,448. Kelley Blue Book says this is a ""great price,"" and $1,233 below their Fair Price calculation.

I plan to put $10k down and got pre-approved for a $14,000 loan at 6.49% for 60 months, shaking out to a car payment of $275.33 per month.

**Me:**

My gross pay is about $90k per year ($7.5k per month), and I am maxing my retirement accounts. Rent is $1,200 per month. After all taxes, insurance, and retirement contributions, my paychecks come in every two weeks at around $1,800. I have $15k in student loan debt at 4.5% interest rate, and am currently paying about $150 a month towards it.

**Conclusion:**

I loathe going into debt, but I need a car for work. To me, the math says I can afford this car. I would like a second opinion from someone who has purchased at least one car in their lifetime.

Reddit,Accountable,Any experience with EverBank?,"Looking to open a HYSA and NerdWallet has given a pretty glowing review of EverBank's HYSA which sits just north of 5% APY, no minimum balance and no monthly fees, FDIC insured, etc.

Only concern is I've never heard of EverBank before, and I'm wondering if going with a more familiar financial institution like Barclay's or SoFI, even if the rates are a few ticks below EverBank might be a better option?

If you've opened an account with EverBank, how do you like their services? I'd be looking to just maintain an emergency savings fund in a HYSA that will grow into personal savings as well, so it needs to be easily accessible and easy to maintain. Seeing as it's purely online banking, I'm imagining I'd need to use ATMs for pulling cash from EverBank which may limit the total withdrawals I can make at a given time, unless they operate like a CU and work in a shared network with physical banks?",2024-03-05 13:36:24,24.0,71.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Is 10k enough for an emergency fund?,"Hi all,
I keep a separate brokerage account simply for emergencies. I depleted some of these funds in 2021 and recently began saving money in the account again. November of last year I had a little over 4k in the account. Today I am now a few hundred dollars short of 10k. Its taken me about year to save this money and I’m wondering when I can take it easy on the saving. I would continue to put away extra cash as long as I can afford to, but is 10k a safe nest egg for emergencies only? Or should I set another goal? I will be 25 in February and don’t have any debt or significant assets aside from my investment portfolio. Thanks!

After reviewing some of your very helpful comments I would like to add that my monthly expenses are around 2000 a month and I make around 50k a year in an entry level position in my desired career field. I keep my COL has low as possible but I do live in South Florida. With this being the case I’m sure I still have a ways to go but I will keep at it. The compound interest along with my contributions have gotten me to this point and now that I am at this threshold I will also consider taking the money out of the market and perhaps leaving it in a money market or other savings.

Reddit,Accountable,Tax and investment advice to deal with 401k required minimum distribution,"Good afternoon everyone!  My mother-in-law asked me for some advice on her situation and I'd like to get some feedback if possible.  She's trying to maximize her funds, minimize her tax burden.

A little bit about her:

* Turned 72 this year and therefore next year she'll be required to take the minimum distribution.  She's not touched it yet, doesn't need the cash at present and is doing fine on her Social Security.
* RMD will be about $20k (and will almost double her current annual income).
* SS is about $24k a year.
* 401k is mostly in stocks according to her (she's not very savvy, I will be reviewing myself to better understand positions).
* Does not currently have a Roth or taxable brokerage account.
* Lives in CT.
* House is paid off but does have an property tax bill for it of $8k/yr.  CT gives a credit of $200 for her tax bracket towards home taxes paid.
* Not married or planning to get married, lives with long-term partner.



My thoughts:

* Start moving 401k funds into less risky investments due to her age.
* Open Roth and taxable brokerage accounts for her.
* Use RMD to max Roth, put rest in taxable brokerage.  Similar investments as the 401k, lower risk stuff due to age.

Do you think my plan is good?  Is there anything else you would do or something different?  In the short term to limit risk but maximize her return should I be looking for other vehicles like CDs while the returns aren't too bad on them (I know with the Fed rate changes this isn't going to last)?",2024-11-14 18:20:44,1.0,18.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

The idea is to to open a 3rd account, a Checking account for monthly payments so my active spending and my monthly payments don't come from the same account and backfire on me.

Reddit,Accountable,Reviewing Mom’s Finances to See If She Can Retire - What To Look For?,"Mom (67) and I haven’t always been very close and she has never been very open about her financial position. She still works and while it was supposed to be more of a part time thing, it’s been full time. While speaking with her the other day I asked what her plan to retire is and she said she doesn’t think she’ll be able to fully retire for at least 3-5 years. 

After her providing me a verbal synopsis of her accounts, I don’t think that’s true and think she can retire today. Now I’ll be sitting down with her and my brother to go over this and I want to make sure I’m not missing anything. For context I’ve calculated my retirement numbers for myself but don’t want to misguide her. I will also be recommending that she work with a fee only financial advisor once we figure out approximate retirement timeline. 

Things I’ve asked for:
- current monthly budget 
- ideal retirement budget (ie travel, house cleaner, etc)
- estimated social security monthly payment (she hasn’t pulled yet because someone told her to wait until 70… I want to do the math to determine the break even point on that) 
- retirement account balance and any/all other cash funds 
- any remaining debt 

Basically, I plan to review her planned monthly expenses, backing out her SS and small pension payments, and using the 4% rule to estimate if she has enough for her to retire, if she should still work for a bit or just lower her living expenses to be able to retire. 

Is there anything else I’m missing?

I would much rather her spend everything she has in retirement and live life the way she wants than to skimp and leave an inheritance for us.

I was making 280k base plus a bonus of aprox 150 k and vested stocks of aprox 100k

Taking the demotion would drop my base pay to about 200k, bonus, and stock would drop by half.

I also have about 500k in unvested options that I would walk away from if I took the severance.  

Am I crazy  to consider taking the demotion ?

Reddit,Accountable,"30-Day Challenge #11: Audit your insurance coverage! (November, 2024)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Audit your insurance coverage!** How long has it been since you examined your coverage or gotten a quote from another company to look for cheaper insurance? As your life evolves, it's important to make sure you update your insurance coverage as well. This is also a good way to save some money if you can find a better deal for insurance elsewhere or if you find yourself overinsured in some specific area.

## Why insurance?

Insurance is an approach to handle the problem of *risk*. Most likely, during your life, one or more of these things will happen: you will be in a vehicle accident, you or someone close to you will experience serious illness or injury, or you will lose your job. Positive events have associated risk as well: ask anyone who has had a child, puppy, house, or marriage.

You can choose to *retain* each of those risks: decide that if the bad thing happens, you can afford to pay for it, to self-insure. For example, if you lose a laptop, you can buy another one. You can also *reduce* the risk, say, by not driving on icy streets or by having chains on your tires.  The other ways to deal with risk are to *avoid* it (don't buy a puppy) or *transfer* it (insurance!).

Most of us don’t think about risk until the bad thing happens. We are in a vehicle crash with an expensive car, someone is injured, and only then it dawns on us that we might be underinsured.

For many major risks, most people share the risk with an insurance company through various insurance products. If you own a vehicle, most likely you will be required by your state to have liability coverage (personal injuries and property damage caused by you). If you have a mortgage, your mortgage holder will require you to have homeowners insurance and some landlords will require renters insurance. Other types of insurance are optional, but may be desirable if available, for example, disability insurance.

## Audit your insurance coverage

Take a minute to think about what insurance coverage you currently have, whether you may be paying too much, and whether your coverage limits are appropriate:

* Car Insurance
* Health / Vision / Dental Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Homeowners / Renters Insurance
* Jewelry Insurance

Although insurance is an important financial tool to protect you against emergencies, it can also be a major drain on your budget. Insurance agents often use the fact that *some* insurance is important to make you feel that *the more insurance you have, the better off you are*.

It's wise to **only insure what you need to insure**. What do you need to insure? Anything that you could not easily afford to replace with your cash savings or where the loss would significantly set you back financially. In the next 30 days, review not only the types of insurance you have, but the level of coverage you have in each type. Here are some ideas for various types of insurance:

## Car Insurance

Assess all the types of coverage you have on your car. See the wiki article on [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance) for more details and ways to save money. For example, if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, call your insurance company and see if they provide a low-mileage discount.

Liability insurance is required by law if you drive and is very important: Would you be able to pay out a $300,000 lawsuit if you injure someone in a car accident? Liability insurance is not a great place to skimp.

Coverages for ""uninsured motorists"" (an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or your passengers) and ""medical payments"" (you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident) are also worth having. They are less expensive than liability coverage and the irresponsibility of others is a major risk.

Also consider whether your ""collision"" and ""comprehensive"" deductibles coverage is appropriate or necessary, especially if you have an older car or significant savings. Eliminating or reducing these types of coverage can reduce your insurance bill, but you'll be left on the hook to replace or repair your own car if you (or mother nature) damage it.

Finally, when you see car insurance advertisements selling you ""better car replacement"" or ""one model year newer"" insurance, realize that this is a **great** deal for the insurer and not as great for their customers. Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done two or more of the following things:

* Read more about a type of insurance that you don't currently have.
* Created an up-to-date home inventory of your belongings.
* Requested a quote from a different insurance company or inquired about potential discounts from your current insurance company.
* Read the policy document for at least one of your insurance policies (you should know which ""perils"" the insurance company covers and which are excluded).

Reddit,Accountable,Can former employer release 401k to some employees and not all?,"The company I worked for was a property management company that managed 30 properties for an Owner.

Reddit,Accountable,Would you pay cash or finance a car in my situation,"I am hoping to get a bit of advice for an upcoming purchase. My wife needs a new vehicle and we are likely purchasing a used low-mileage one for $40k-$45k price range. There is no need to review the purchase itself - she keeps her cars for years and I do a lot of the maintenance. There are two cars that fit our specific requirements, both are similar price range used, so that is locked in. 

My question is whether or not to pay cash or finance. I know many are going to ask about emergency funds etc so as a background, we are good with our retirement contributions, kids college funds are set, we have a 1 year emergency fund that is in a high yield account (a bit extreme, but I went through layoffs in 2008 and it was a painful experience I'd rather not repeat, especially now with kids), and we've got a savings account that is basically another year's worth of expenses. I then have another separate vacation/whatever house emergency fund/car purchase fund in high yield with more than enough to purchase the vehicle we're looking at. We are pretty cautious with how we spend and have no debt aside from a mortgage.  

The high yield is 4.5%, the car loan would be 5.19%. I am torn on what the right thing to do here is. On the one hand paying cash means I don't have to think about payments, don't have to deal with a loan, plus save the 0.69%. On the other hand taking the loan means I'm not laying out a big chunk of cash, and if I pay it over 3 years it basically costs me about $500 more than what I will earn in the high yield earnings. I doubt I will do anything with the money other than high yield, so while I can argue ""opportunity cost"" on paying cash for the car, I think its safe to assume it will just sit. 

So, what would you all do? Pay cash right? ",2024-10-24 20:23:53,0.0,13.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Backdoor Roth Conversion Planning - Tax Year 2025,"I am looking for some guidance regarding Backdoor Roth conversions for my wife and I in tax year 2025 as our income will be higher than the income limits for direct Roth IRA.

Another point to clarify, I created a Fidelity Traditional IRA account in preparation for next year which I'll keep empty until then when I fund it up to $7000.

With the recent news I am of the opinion that most of our personal data is available somewhere for the right price for nefarious activities.

This is probably setting up the stage for scammers to do serious damage if they know where to look.

So how are you protecting your life savings? Just keep a vigilant eye on your accounts and flag to the institution as soon as something happens hoping for the best?

For instance, I just reviewed Fidelity security measures:

1. Strong username/password. >>> change passwords often with strong password generators. If you are locked out already I'm not sure how this helps.
2. Extra login with MFA >>> Can this be defeated with Sim Card swap attack?
3. Security alert texts >>> once #2 is implemented this is useless unless you are using another number for this
4. Fidelity MyVoice. Not sure about this. Never tried

Perhaps my pessimistic hat is wearing heavy on me today but this is one extra worry that I probably will have to carry on forever.

I have some money in shares, bitcoin and high yield savings accounts. I have about 15k in total across everything in my name.

Monthly payments: 
I pay £500 a month into my mortgage, £500 on other bills and about £200-500 into savings and shares a month, depending on the month

Yearly bills including car insurance, rates, house insurance, heating oil etc is about 1k+ a year.

Money left over mostly goes to holidays and trips away. I'm not much of a spender, I don't buy myself anything unless I need it. I'm more of a saver. 

I have 47k left to pay off on my mortgage. I have 1.99% interest rate for the next year. I have options to overpay each month and pay lump sums. 

Is it better to have more money available in my shares and savings or try to pay off my mortgage?

Reddit,Accountable,Tally SST collections headache ,"Tally’s sudden shutdown and the transfer of my account to SST caught me by surprise. I only found out when I tried to make my Tally payment, and the app was not working. No big deal, I knew this could happen as per the contract, and it’s not like I’ve never had an account transferred to another company.

I called SST to find out who they were and to make sure I was contacting the correct company. Later, while speaking with an SST representative, I discovered I had received an email from an Alorica email address. However, the email looked like a phishing attempt. After reviewing my past communications with Tally, I saw that they mentioned SST, but there was no mention of Alorica.

When speaking to the SST rep on the phone, I was told my balance, but it didn’t sound right. So, I sent a dispute letter via email and Certified Mail with Return Receipt. I followed the instructions from the contract I had with Tally, but SST did not adhere to those guidelines.

Instead of following the contract’s guidelines to investigate the issue, notify me they were working on it, and halt all collection activities, SST started calling, texting, and emailing me.

It seems like they are violating the contract’s terms and possibly state and federal guidelines. When I asked if they were a collection agency, they said no, but according to California’s Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, they are. I repeatedly asked SST for their license number and business status in California, but they refused to provide it.

All I asked for was my statements to verify the balance, and I would have started making payments as soon as I got that information.

But NO! SST chose to harass me, ignored Tally’s original contract terms, and still expected me to abide by them. It also seems they’re not legally able to collect in California.

What a headache. I’ll soon be 30 days late.

I have ~310K cash, in saving account, earning 4% interest. Was thinking to change to a bigger house but now I don’t think that will happen. 
Have ~210 in retirement plan (401k), 30k in stock, 10k in Roth IRA. Don’t have a lot knowledge about investments and don’t wanna take a lot of risk, so mainly buying some ETF. 
Have a house, valued at 690k, has $350 Morgage left, monthly payment at $2200 including tax and interest and insurance. 
Monthly spend other than Morgage is around $2k. No other debt, cost include car insurance, food, utility, essential and a little bit budget of eating out or social. 
Soon I will be have to pay for my own health insurance which will be expensive. 
I know I have funding to live for a whole, but the fear not be able to find a job very soon really terrify me. Open to advice how to best invest my cash to optimize the return (both short term and long term?) Thank you! ",2024-11-26 01:06:51,1.0,6.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,HO insurance spike triggered an escrow delinquency + shortfall and seems unrecoverable. Now What?,"First time homeowner and I live alone.  Its year 4 of my mortgage and there was a minor increase i my HO insurance (+1000).  I should have noticed a problem then but didnt.  

Basically, the insurance company billed escrow in July but my escrow evaluation is 8 months later.  I only ever got a confirmation that ""Payment was submitted for yadda yadda"" and had to wait a while to see what my new payment would be if the insurance/taxes got weird.  In year 5, my payment when up, but it was whatever.  

July roles around (9 months ago) and my insurance goes up again, but I wont know this has happened or by how much until February. Previously I had hazard and flood for a little under 3,000 per year.  My last HO insurance bill was over $7,000.  Escrow paid it 3 weeks early (discovered much later) and starts this whole shit show off.

Escrow, of course, did not predict such an insane increase but paid it without saying anything, sending my account several thousands of dollars into the negative, where it would remain until Febuary.

In Febuary I got the letter.  I understand how the delinquency, shortfalls, and reserve requirements work (not that the account every really adhered to the minimums reservations despite being on autopay).

The huge insurance bill (more than principle+interest+taxes lolwat) drastically altered the reserve requirements.  Which are being applied for the new payment schedule.....and here is where I almost had a heart attack.

My $1,0xx/month mortgage is now $2,267 dollars a month.  I keep going over the math hoping for an error, but its not looking like it,  The delinquency from going crazy negative + the reserve variance are both being spread over the next 12, but I wont make it that long.

As soon as I found out, I contacted an insurance broker to help me find something to get away from my other policy, however the bank is telling me my new payment will reflect the new insurance rate, starting at the next escrow review in Feb 2025.....a few months after I likely go bankrupt.


So, what now?  Do I really have to sell my house?  Is there some rule that escrow has to contact you for suspicious bills?  The whole thing just feels so slimey.

I did visit the Credit Union lender office asking how to proceed, the lending representative seemed very unsettled, she kept trying to msg someone then call them, but wasnt getting through in repeated attempts.  After about 30m of this, I was told to find new insurance and go from there.

Right now, the broker is plugging away and while im sitting at home thinking, ""Fuck you Gecko"".",2024-04-09 09:29:43,45.0,31.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,"Should I sell my HSA investments and ""start over""?","I should start by stating that I am certainly no expert in the world of investing and finance, so please take that into consideration if my line of thinking doesn't make much sense or if I've left out some details... I have tried to do my own research and reviewed other posts on this subreddit (and others), but was having a very hard time finding answers that seemed to apply to my situation.

First, I'll do my best to explain my situation... I (28 Y/O) have an HSA through Fidelity which both me and my employer contribute to (up to the limit each year). I should mention that I will continue to fully fund the HSA each year. Currently, about 60% of this account is held in my core position - FDRXX money market (I like the idea of having an ample ""cash safety net"" in the event that any large medical expenses arise in the near term and the money market has been fetching reasonable returns imo). The remaining 40% is spread across 4 funds which have yielded a 25% return - a number I'm quite happy with. My core position is no longer growing - all of my bi-weekly contributions are being invested in the 4 funds. 

My question is this: Does it make sense at this point to sell my positions in the 4 funds and place the money in the core money market (or another investment/vehicle) to essentially ""lock in"" my 25% return? Knowing that I fully intend to continue investing in the same 4 funds. Essentially, I envision repeating this process periodically (maybe every few years) to lock in any reasonable earnings that may occur and grow my core position. I honestly don't know if that approach makes any sense. 

I should mention that I'm not necessarily trying to completely optimize and squeak every last dollar out of my HSA investment strategy. I guess I'd say that my goals with this account are 3-fold: (1) Keep some money on hand for near-term medical emergencies (I understand the concept of long-term HSA reimbursements) - my current core position feels adequate for this, (2) target moderate long-term growth for medical expenses in retirement, and (3) simplicity (ideally I don't want to have to make many changes to my investments/strategies in this account)

Happy to provide additional info/context if it would help.

I used to invest around 2k USD per month into my investment Account at Fidelity. I thought I could do better by having a financial advisor and transferred all my money from Fidelity Brokerage Account(\~25K) to Northwestern Mutual Investment Account. The Northwestern Mutual financial advisor proposed to invest 1K into my Investment Account and around 500USD per month into Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Policy. I agreed and paid 500 USD for one month. After reading a lot of reviews, I found out that the Life Insurance policy is a bad deal and I have immediately requested him to cancel the Life Insurance Policy. Now, I am having second thoughts about having my investment account with Northwestern Mutual. My questions are

   * Was I scammed into buying the Life Insurance Policy for 500 USD per month? Is it okay to immediately cancel this Life Insurance Policy now?
   * Should I move my Investment Account from Northwestern Mutual to Fidelity back? The advisor reported that they will take a 3% cut from my Investment Account as a Fee and promised an overall returns of 9%

Reddit,Accountable,Credit Card payment: Is Chase screwing with me?,"I moved to the US a few months ago, and opened a checking account with Chase, and got a Chase Freedom credit card. I set the credit card payment on autopay from my checking account. 

Yesterday, my credit card got declined from two places, which is weird because I paid the statement balance on my last cycle via autopay and my current credit balance was like $200, and my “available credit” was showing as $6, although my monthly limit is $1800. I called the customer care and they said the payment for my last bill hasn’t been processed cause it’s the weekend, and should be processed tomorrow. This didn’t make much sense as my autopay date was set to 22 Oct (which was the due date and there was no way for me to change the autopay date on the app), and it had been 5 days, and the money was deducted from my checking account.  It shouldn’t take so many days for a payment from a Chase checking account for a Chase credit card, right?

Today I went to the bank branch, and one of the bank managers called up someone and spoke to someone about my complaint. She didn’t give my account or credit card number or any other information. And then she hung up and told me it was taking time cause they were reviewing the transaction for money laundering. Seriously?! An autopay Chase credit card payment from a Chase account was being reviewed by Chase for money laundering? Then she said it was “randomly selected” for screening. She told me it should go through tonight, and that I should be able to use it from tomorrow. Today my available credit was showing as $1, less than $6 yesterday. So my question is: am I also paying interest on this transaction which I made on time but apparently hasn’t been processed because of this? When I asked the bank manager, she said if they’re charging you interest, you can call and ask them to adjust that in next month’s cycle. 

This whole thing is just a pain at this point. Is this normal or am I being scammed by Chase in some way? I just moved here so I’m not super familiar with the US banking system, but this just… Doesn’t feel right.

Is there something I can / should do in this situation?


TLDR: Unable to use Chase credit card cause I’ve reached my credit limit because my previous payment of the last cycle hasn’t fully gone through and they’re apparently “randomly” reviewing it for “money laundering”.",2024-10-28 22:08:53,0.0,9.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Best budget or spending tracking software for my needs?,"What I'm looking for is this:

An interface with all my activity from various accounts automatically imported, which will allow me to quickly and easily categorize (drag and drop?) each transaction into a category. That's it. Being able to do this quickly and easily probably means I should be able to search all transactions, select and categorize multiple at a time, etc.

I really just want to start by keeping track of what we are spending in typical and customized budget categories. Then for example at year end we can review that to evaluate spending, plan for and adjust budget going forward. Hopefully the software could also attempt to automatically categorize transactions, as I recall Mint used to do, perhaps improving over time based on my previous manual categorizations.

I tried YNAB for a few days but it seemed a bit difficult/too much for me at this point. I think I am focused more on tracking spending as opposed to a ""zero based"" budget currently.

Reddit,Accountable,Small Second Job Tax Question,"Hey all- Last year I picked up a very part time second job in retail, primarily because I enjoyed it and got discounts but def not for the money. Its a seasonal winter gig so the income comes Jan-April and then Nov-December. Reviewing my paystubs from end 23 and beginning 24, I estimate my income at the end of 24 will be maybe $4k from the second job. My primary job makes a bit over $100k. 
Last year I checked the box that I had two jobs on my W4 for my higher paying job as the form suggested. My pay went down a painful amount (there were also some increases in benefit costs and my retirement is set as % based so that probably had a small impact as well). I thought that Federal taxes must have just gone up significantly. When I checked today and compared my federal income tax paid YTD between now and approximately the same time last year, I've already paid over $6k more in Federal taxes with no change in salary or filing status at my higher paying job. 
I was contemplating asking for a raise at my higher paying job and wanted to see what different salaries would do to my take home so I used a salary calculator. When trying to get the calculator to match up with my paystubs I noticed a massive difference coming from checking the two jobs box. If the amount I'm paying in extra federal taxes for having two jobs is more than the income I make, it makes having a second job an expense which seems wrong. 

I would rather just owe a small amount in federal taxes than have the government hold onto all my extra money. I'm perfectly capable of moving money into savings and investments on my own (though I do remember what it was like living paycheck to paycheck and essentially using my refund as a savings account). 

Should I just uncheck that box? Is that considered lying on my taxes?

Reddit,Accountable,Late fee on bill paid in full,"Hello! I apologize if there is a better place to ask this, but I'm at a loss as to what to say/do.

I got my first autoloan in June of this year, with payments starting in July. I read through the contract about payments and all it says is that the full bill must be paid every month, and any late balance must be paid in full within 10 days.

For July I paid the whole bill all at once, and everything was fine. After that I set up a reoccurring auto-pay to come out every payday for a bit over half of what I owe each month. For August this resulted in three payments due to how things lined up, and in September this was two payments.

This last Friday I received notice that I was late on my bill and a late fee was applied. I checked payment history and both September payments went through without issue, so I raised a ticket with support. I am being told now that it's because there was no note on my account that I would be making split payments.

I reviewed my contract once more, and there is no mention of pre-authorization needed for split payments at all. I brought this up to them and the official response was, ""This is not something in your contract, this is how things are processed on our end."". Please note that no late fee was applied for August where I also made split payments. 

There is no mention of this anywhere that I can find, and now they are claiming I still owe for this entire month after I made a payment already since that was covering my ""late"" balance from September.

This is my only loan that has ever worked like that and I'm just confused how that even makes sense. If the full bill is being paid every month, and they even accepted split payments in August without a late fee, how can it be justified that September was late?

Is there something I should ask or say to them about this, as I'm genuinely at a loss as to what to do. I can afford to pay the whole bill again this month, but it just seems unreasonable to receive a full payment for the whole month and for them to claim that it's not enough.

Reddit,Accountable,I need help understanding if this annuity my immigrant dad purchased is good or not. How do I make sense of the numbers?,"Hi /PF - My immigrant dad purchased an annuity back in 2021 from Nassau and even he doesn't quite understand what he purchased, but he did so without telling anyone in the family and now I'm trying to understand if this is a worthwhile purchase, or if I should take the penalty to cancel the contract and throw the $ into a HYSA or SPY500 fund. 

For background my parents are both 60 y/o and my dad is on SSDI receiving $3k/mo. My mom works a part-time job, but their house is paid for so it is only monthly bills for which I cover half of them. They have about 500k saved in their 401k. 

Below are the details of the annuity that I asked the agent and he sent me. I didn't know what exact questions to asked so I searched online for them. **But how do I make sense of this annuity in terms of if it is a good deal for him? Am I supposed to have my dad take out money yearly, or just leave it there to grow? Does it make more sense to cancel the contract?** 

Any background or further information would be very helpful, or if there's someone who can break this down so I can understand what it means! I am quite financial-savy but annuities are confusing me. 

1) Initial investment amount in 2021 - $102,819.11

2) It is an indexed annuity

3) It is a 2.65% expected rate of return is based on the performance of the s&p 500 index your credits you get from that. We anticipate you should have a average rate of return of 5% or better of the 10 year period but it is largely based on how the s&p performs. 

4) Your money gets credited annually based on interest earned from the s&p 500 index from point to point every year on your contract anniversary.

5) You may withdrawl 10% of your account value penalty free for the 1st 10 years. After 10 years you may liquidate or transfer all of the money in the account. Maturity date of 2059 is just a year that they will make you take all the money out even if you still had some in there.

6) Currently my Dad pays a 1% annual fee of the account value to get an enhanced participation rate of what the s&p 500 does annually. With this fee he gets a larger percentage of what the s&p 500 index does vs the no fee option. There is the option if he would like to opt out of the higher index participation rate, after that there will be no other fee. The rest of your contract has no other fees. 

7) In my Dec 2023 statement it says cash surrender value of $95,305.80. The surrender value is what you get if you cancel the contract during the surrender period which is a 10 year period.

There's some additional info the agent provided me when I asked for details:

""Keep in mind, the last time we spoke I recommended and offered to get you into a better annuity that would have higher participation rates and caps plus a bonus if you are dissatisfied with the current contract. 

As an agent advisor, we have no idea what rates will be like in the future. Since 2021, annuity rates have risen dramatically just like CD and money market rates. What does this mean, when you enter into an annuity contract during lower rate environments, you tend to get lower rates for the duration of the contract (10 years). When you enter into an annuity contract during a higher rate environment, you will get better rates for the duration of that contract. That is why we try to review your contract every 2 years so see if it is best to keep you there or get you out of it and into something better should there be a better fit at the current time.

One is with Athene (A+ rated). They have a 16% bonus upfront and better participation rates and caps that you currently have at Nassau. If we rolled into this account your beginning account value would be $110,554. 

The other is with Midland National (A+ Rated) They have a 19% bonus and also better rates vs Nassau. If we rolled into this account with the 20% bonus your account value would start out at $114,366. (currently your account value is $107,027).

Both of them have a feature built in that will allow you to surrender your contract after 4 years without penalty on the money you put in and liquidate without a fee. Athene has better rate and growth potential by a little.

Keep in mind, the main and sole purpose of this portion of your money is to protect it from risk and keep it safe. The indexed annuity has the ability to go better than any other safe investment vehicle over the long term (CD, Money Market, High Yield Savings, ect.).""",2024-08-06 19:30:48,6.0,15.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,Feeling Duped by Wealth Manager – Seeking Advice on Next Steps,"I've been with a wealth manager since 2016 and was careful in selecting him and his team. In 2022, he retired and assured me that I'd be taken care of by a new advisor. At the time, I was just 4 weeks away from getting married and transitioning out of a major position at a tech company.

There was no formal handoff meeting, and the new advisor never reviewed our risk tolerance, didn’t understand our existing investments, and had a poor grasp of how bond duration affects values. Yet somehow, in our first meeting seven months later, he convinced us to invest in 8 specific stocks he “puts all his clients into.” This was completely outside my risk profile, and I can’t believe I let him pressure me into it.

Fast forward six months, and I checked my account only to discover that 60% of what he was supposed to invest was sitting in a money market account within a strategic advisory account, and I was being charged a 1% fee. When I asked why the funds weren’t invested as my husband and I had agreed, he claimed he was ""dollar cost averaging,"" something we never discussed. I also asked if fees were being charged on the money market portion, and he initially said no.

After pushing for a detailed fee report, it took 32 days to receive a CVS file filled with indecipherable codes. I kept following up to verify his claim that we weren’t being charged fees. Another 30 days later, my advisor finally admitted that we were being charged 1% on everything in the account, including the money market funds. When I asked for a refund on the fees and expressed disappointment at being misled, he dismissed my concerns, saying, “You made money, and your last advisor did this all the time.”

I escalated the issue to compliance, but after a week of waiting, I was connected to his manager, who promised to address my concerns with compliance. Sixty days later, I received a generic response from the Director of Customer Relations, essentially saying ""buyer beware."" On top of that, the advisor falsely claimed he had met with me to discuss my risk profile. I sent written evidence to support all of my concerns, but the response I got was dismissive, saying there was no case number or investigator names they could provide.

My question is: How does a company investigate customer concerns if they don’t even talk to the customer? Has anyone been in a similar situation, and what steps should I take?

Reddit,Accountable,New credit card opened just prior to pre-approval,"We are applying for mortgage loan and  just got the conditional approval from the lender. Then when I reviewed my initial loan doc, I noticed one minor/major discrepancy. We opened a new credit card in September, and it just happened to not show up in the credit report the lender pulled for pre-approval in October. Therefore it's not listed on the loan doc either. We didn't open any accounts during the quiet period.

In the conditional loan approval, another inquiry was detected by the lender. And they required a explanation. That's another loan application after the pre-approval, which we decided to stop and stick with the current lender.

But the new credit line is not detected, still. This might probably be because that the lender is paying attention to only new inquires, while my card application didn't generate one. 

I'm hesitant whether to report this to the lender. Our current credit scores dropped from the pre-approval due to 1) this new account 2) inquiries during the loan process which might disqualify us from getting loan from any lender. I don't want the lender to pull my credit score again. They won't do that if no new debt is introduced in my understanding.

Meanwhile, I'm super worried that this could be found by closing eventually, when I have less time and will be more troublesome than communicating this with the lender right now.

We did have balance on this card. We paid off everything as soon as I found this issue. But the statement will be generated next week.

I started from part time, then they asked me to be full time and I genuinely like my job. The people are nice, I am able to work from home 3 days a week, have flex time so I can leave early if I need, and the health benefits are great. While the industry it is in is not my passion, I do not have much to complain about.

I saw a posting from a very small startup that I follow on social media that they were looking for an equivalent of what I do at my current job. However there were some downsides - it would be in office, no Flex Time, and also the job would be brand new - they have never had this position in their company before. I figured with the right salary, I would do it. I sent in my resume and cover letter, had an interview. We jived really well together and I am very passionate about the space that they are in, and think it would be really awesome to work with them. 

I received an offer today, but the pay rate was for $20/hr. with a review is 3 months. 

I can not afford to take a pay cut. The posting did not say the salary, and during the interview it was not discussed. However, as mentioned, with the right salary, it would be worth it. So I would like to counter the offer. I had decided previously that at $28/hr, this job would be a great fit. 

How exactly should I word this? I know that it would be a huge jump to go from $20/hr with possibly a raise in 3 months to $28/hr. My family and friends are telling me to shoot my shot and ask. Do I ask for $30 and then see if they will negotiate down to $28? That just seems like too high of a jump to be even reasonable from their starting point. 

I’ve never counter offered a position before, so any advice would be great! ",2024-10-11 05:46:26,1.0,8.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Need advice on better budgeting.,"Hi all, first time posting to this sub. I’m looking for advice on budgeting and getting myself out of debt. I’m running into a constant cycle of first 2 weeks of the month, I’m fine and then the last 2 weeks of the month Im flat broke to where I’m having to buy essential groceries to feed my family on a credit card, which I would rather not do. I know there are things I out there that I may not have thought of. 

Here’s my situation: I’m 31M and I make 65K/ year and my wife makes roughly 39K a year. Our rent is just over 1500. We have the normal bills obviously (utilities, internet, phone, car insurance, etc) but our main detriment is all the different debts that we are paying all over the place. At one point a few years ago, my wife and I were able to pay for these things and be comfortable enough not to sweat about it. Funny thing is we made less money back then. Now, I’m considering getting a second job just to make ends meet. 

As for the debts themselves, I have the following:

Two car payments (my wife’s and mine) equaling about 700 total for both.

Credit card debt: totaling to 7K (this debt was to absorb a bunch of medical debt)

A “pregnancy contract” that I’m having to pay bi-weekly for (believe me, we looked at other options) which is costing me $250 every 2 weeks.

A loan I took out to move into my current house.

Another credit card that my wife opened at a clothing retailer.

Then I have other expenses like paying my babysitter, groceries every 2 weeks, gas for our cars and some subscriptions.

We have Netflix, Peacock, and NFL+ (I refuse to pay for cable so I just watch games on my phone). We also have subscriptions to PlayStation and Square Enix (I play FFXIV).

Like I said before, it always seems at the beginning of the month, we are golden. So we will have a night out with our daughter and maybe buy a few things frivolous like clothes or a video game or something. Nothing too ridiculous. Then the last week of the month hits and we have literally $-12 in our account.

Here what we have tried so far to fix this:

Changed banks to get a better APY (Went from USAA to SoFi)

Called some of the companies that issue out our regular bills to change due dates

Cut down our subscriptions and anything else we didn’t need.

Made a budget sheet in Excel to track spending and make it a habit to review it every 2 weeks

Borrowed money from family to help us get ahead and get stabilized. (Kind of a last resort thing for us)

There’s other things I’m sure I have done that I can’t think of right now. This is where I’m at. Any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. This has been extremely stressful for us, especially since we have another child on the way next year.

Reddit,Accountable,Question about Northwestern mutual,"Hello everyone,

I am about to sign some legal documents with a financial advisor from Northwestern, but as I gave my SSN to him I decided to read some reviews before the paperwork gets sent over.  I noticed a LOT of negative reviews, but for things that don't seem to add up to my current setting as far as I can tell.

The biggest complaint is that they are just a glorified life insurance company.  My Financial Advisor has informed me of the benefit of a life insurance account, but that is not planning to be the main focus.  The suggestion is 80%-20% in a stock exchange account and life insurance respectively, then a similar distribution of my income later on.

The other complaint (though much more minor) is that they do not offer financial advice, but he explained benefits of each plan (obviously he explains the life insurance plan in this segment), helped me figure out if I really wanted to get involved in real-estate (mutually decided I would be better off building up my finances for \~5 more years at my current rate), and even helped me figure out budgeting plans.

Is there some red flag I'm missing here?

EDIT:

New information as this has been referenced a few times:

-I have no dependents, I am 24 years old

-From what it sounds like my ""Financial Advisor"" is not a fee-only advisor, which I have come to learn is bad

-Intention of the life insurance account was the ability to withdraw up to the initial investment amount without taxes, or ""loan"" the money from the account and pay it back while it grows (the ideal scenario was to buy a house in cash, then pay back the loan with the mortgage).  The scenario was made as I stated I would like to get into property investments, but am unsure where exactly to start as of right now.

  
EDIT:

additional information I have gathered

-He has explained he is not employed by Northwestern, he is the ""middle man""

-Fee is 1.5% which goes down (obv, as mentioned in wiki and by others on Reddit).  Which I believe to be considered what most people call ""crazy high WTF are you doing?!""",2024-05-13 20:18:20,0.0,28.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Need Advice on Fraud with Wise and Negative Balance Issue,"Hello everyone,

I recently experienced a fraud situation and am looking for advice on how to proceed. Here’s what happened:

I realized I was a victim of fraud and immediately contacted Wise to dispute the transaction while it was still pending. Wise customer service assured me that the payments were flagged and told me the situation was being addressed. I froze my Wise card and locked my bank card for added security.

However, a few hours later, I noticed that the flagged fraudulent payments had still gone through, despite my earlier report to Wise. To prevent further unauthorized transactions, I unlinked my bank card from my Wise account.

I then contacted the Wise Card Disputes Team to recover the lost funds. Unfortunately, their investigation revealed the following:

* The funds had already been sent out and could not be reversed.
* Attempts to recall the funds from the fraudulent merchant were unsuccessful, as the merchant did not respond.
* Wise advised me to contact my local consumer protection agency and the authorities for further help.

Feeling unsupported, I escalated the matter to local police and consumer protection BC and my bank. Thankfully, my bank officer reviewed the case and successfully reversed the fraudulent transactions from their end. After this experience, I no longer felt secure using Wise and decided to close my account.

However, Wise has since emailed me multiple times, requesting that I add funds to cover the negative balance caused by the reversed transactions. Considering the circumstances and my decision to close the account, I do not feel it is appropriate to link my bank account again or provide additional funds. As a victim of fraud, I believe it is unfair to be held liable for these charges.

Despite my polite replies explaining the situation, Wise has insisted that I repay the balance and has hinted at taking further action, possibly involving collections.

What can I do in this situation? Has anyone experienced a similar issue with Wise or another platform? I would appreciate any advice or guidance on how to handle this.

Thank you in advance for your help!",2024-12-04 22:55:25,1.0,0.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,"Looking for advice on setting up new checking account, savings account, and credit card","Got my first full-time job (\~90k) and am looking to better organize my finances. Currently, I have a joint checking account with my parents at Wells Fargo and a beginner credit card to start building my credit (\~740)

I’m looking to get a better credit card and set up an emergency fund. I’ve looked into opening a high-yield savings account with Wells Fargo or investing in an MMF for my emergency fund. However, I’ve noticed that Wells Fargo’s savings accounts don’t offer great interest rates, and after seeing other negative reviews about WF in general, I'm now considering opening a new checking account also. 

Given this situation, I am wondering if there are any ""cheat codes"" or really great incentives that I can take advantage of in this situation by opening all of these accounts (checking, credit, savings) with the same institution.

  
My alternative, if there aren't offerings that would make this strategy worthwhile, is to go the MMF route for the emergency fund, keep my current checking, and look for a credit card that has the best perks to suit my lifestyle. My main expenses are food/groceries and cheap flights here and there. 

  
Thanks for the help!

Reddit,Accountable,Refinance Offer Legit? Or possible scam? ,"I am looking to refinance our mortgage to get off our terrible 7.5% rate. I was contacted today by [Kenico Mortgage Inc](https://kenicomortgage.com/) and they provided me a fee worksheet for 6.3%. They are also waiving all fees except the appraisal which we will need to pay. The waiving of all closing costs is account for in the worksheet via a credit they are providing and it's not listed as getting rolled into the mortgage.

This feels like a pretty incredible no brainer deal given where rates are right now. However, this company is only a few years old and has 0 reviews I can find online. It is listed with the [BBB ](https://www.bbb.org/us/mi/troy/profile/mortgage-broker/kenico-mortgage-services-inc-0332-90051326)and the Loan Officer has the [proper licenses via NMLS](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/INDIVIDUAL/1935629).

Reddit,Accountable,Can medicaid take my grandmother's dividends even though they are coming from an account in a trust?,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this question so please let me know if this should be posted elsewhere.

As the title says, my grandmother has recently applied for Medicaid in New York. Her application is still under review, although she is already in the long-term care facility. From what what I understand, if she gets approved, then all of her assets are then handed over to Medicaid/NY state. If I'm not mistaken, this includes her checking account and my grandfather's pension, which was transferred to my grandmother after my grandfather passed away.

Luckily, my mom and her siblings set up a trust years ago that has them as being the beneficiaries. My grandmother's house is in the trust along with her investment account. Technically, it's a brokerage account but it's called ""Trust: Under Agreement"" when looking at the account page. This account is invested in bond funds that pay dividends monthly. The dividends are then automatically transferred to my grandmother's checking account monthly.

During the Medicaid application process, they do a 5-year look back of your asset transactions to make sure you don't move around assets before applying for Medicaid.

My question is whether or not stopping the transfer of those dividends to the checking account will raise a red flag with the Medicaid people because they can see that those transfers have been going through for years. In my non-expert opinion, it shouldn't be an issue because the account that the dividends are coming from is already in the trust and Medicaid can't touch any of the money in the trust so they shouldn't be able to touch the dividends either. But, we also don't want her to get denied Medicaid because she needs the assistance.

Please let me know if I am incorrect in thinking this way.",2024-11-11 20:26:52,0.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Unauthorized charge by veterinarian possibly tanking my credit score,"Some backstory: 

Me and my partner had a pet who needed emergency + overnight care for several days, I was designated as an emergency contact. Being that my partner and I do not live together yet and the pet resided with him, he assumed all responsibility for payment of the services we received from the vet hospital. He was being updated daily on the payment balance and everything was being billed to him by way of Care Credit and through his own personal financing. At one point, he had to go over the billing with the vet hospital because he believed he was being erroneously charged and he cleared that up with them.

On Wednesday, I checked my personal Care Credit balance and noticed it was $2000+ more than it should have been. When I checked to see who it was that billed me, it was the same vet hospital. I have manyyyy questions as to how this happened, I never once showed them my Care Credit card, a driver's license, or any other identifying/financial information so I can only assume they accessed my Care Credit account through my phone number and billed me that way. I never signed any documents, my partner was the sole signatory.

Am I naive to assume the emergency contact is only contacted for emergencies and not to assume payment for services outside of the primary?

On Wednesday, I was on Discord with my partner while he called the vet hospital on Wednesday to notify them of the charge, remove it from my Care Credit account and put it on his, and to get an explanation. They had no answers but they said the matter would be cleared up in a few days. After reviewing a summary of the billing for the cost of all the medical care received, the day I was billed was clearly billed to his name.

Since I have $2000+ on my Care Credit account than I should, the utilization is now at 100%, the thing is maxed out and my credit score has dropped 35 points.

Is this a permanent hit to my credit score? Will it return back to its previous number when the charge is removed? I've already informed Care Credit but they wanted to open a fraud investigation and I didn't want to escalate it to that. Pls help.",2024-10-18 23:23:02,0.0,5.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,How do I handle this shady ass car dealership before my deal is finalized? [Crossposted],"Update: It took an hour for me to get great answers thank you guys :) The comments have helped me see that the bottom line is whether I'm fully informed and happy with the deal, not who gets my money. I think I'll head back to them in person, get every detail I can, and sit on it for a second knowing what I do now. Thank you!!

--- 

So I (29F) started the purchase of a car on Friday. I left feeling proud for taking a stand on a few things and negotiating the price down before agreeing on it, but can't shake my doubts about the experience. Sorry this is so long. I YouTubed what to expect a little before I went, but was short on time. I didn't exactly go in with a diabolical plan to ruin their day.

**The first offer:** $342 monthly (\*I now know to not do this by monthly when I go back, but here is the context I had at the time) To them I was probably a slam dunk as a first time buyer. I had to look at their absolute cheapest cars due to my situation which is another thing to consider from their end. It was a vague single-page itemized invoice. The monthly price offered was handwritten - $342. No mention of interest rate. I asked, no answer. I tried considering the items on the list after they suggested they can work with me on the monthly. I've been advised not to do that but felt stuck and unsure in the moment. I tried saying I want the cost of the car lower first and then talk monthly, and there was so much going on it just kept being a later thing. Turned down gap insurance. Offered to take the cost off the car if I'd still take the insurance. Once he understood that I'm not buying the gap insurance, dude jumped away with an almost-eye roll the millisecond my sentence was finished (he was now taking care of other clients that came in and was jumping around a lot) It was hectic, 31st of the month so maybe it was just a rough day. No recollection of the total cost in this offer, but I think it was in the high 15k. The gap insurance was either $1,000 or $1,500. The way that process went was super confusing to me and I'll pay closer attention next time.

**The second offer:** $303 monthly - After some time with finance, he brought out the next offer. I should have taken a photo of the original, but off my memory alone I noticed immediately they raised the cost of another item on the list by a few hundred. There could have been more wrong with the second offer than I realized but I didn't have it in front of me and I didn't catch anything. I said ""Hmm. That number's higher."" And he was a bit caught off guard. I pointed out that X said X on the last invoice. He said sorry and took it back to finance again. I let him know I wanted to make sure the numbers are right since I don't have the old invoices to compare it to now that I know there was something to be concerned about. He didn't ever bring those out. Also no recollection of the total cost in this offer. I don't remember the out the door price on this either.

**Last offer:** I can't even remember at this point where we landed at. It's like they knew the longer they'd keep me waiting the less I'd remember about the other prices.  
Car: 2017 Chevy Bolt EV Premier - $12,499  
Trade-In: 2011 Honda CRV - $1,000 (the car is beat up cosmetically so I found it fair, $1500 rough quote on Kelly Blue Book with little details)  
The car was listed 12,499 and then after including my 1,000 trade in the out the door price became something around 14,300. I had to assume it was fair because I know my credit is bad. The monthly was then $282/mo after everything and felt good/like it was acceptable at the time. I also knew they have to make their money somewhere and I do feel bad about working folks and their commissions, and that I can't expect to be a chooser when my credit is garbage and I have no down payment. I looked unamused but said that's fair and shook his hand. I'm now realizing I forgot that included my 1,000 trade in and that the final cost is much more than I realized in the moment. (\*Learned that my credit has nothing to do with the pricing we agree on before getting to the next step, woo) (Also, the 12,499 listing price is *including* the $4k NJ EV tax rebate that counts as down payment. So I guess 16,499)

Right now, I'm thankful the deal isn't done because of my trade-in title needing to be transferred into my name from my family members' name. I think I can walk from this since I haven't put a down payment down or signed off on financing, but I did sign that vague invoice/offer proposal. There's technically a 4k down payment from the government since it was an Electric used car and there's some rebates etc for that in NJ. We also got the car VIN number added to our auto insurance policy that day which I think can be changed.

I'm not trying to get anyone fired. They replied to a recent bad Google review-gone-good saying they terminated the employee they dealt with and they don't endorse whatever it is they did that got edited out. I think it's a work culture problem that's become normalized if anything. I got an uncomfortable feeling from the Final Finance Boss too, because honestly his deal-sealing smile looked like a shit eating grin.

I'm not married to the car. I have no way of knowing how many extra fees are reasonable to expect or not.

* Go to dealer in person and talk full fine print money details + their deception before closing?
* Bail over the phone? Bail in person?
* Do I go to another dealer and potentially waste their time in an attempt to bring their offer back to Dealer 1 to get a better price?
* Do I get my phone charger back from them? Ha
* Anything I'm missing? I have no idea whether assuming that this was ""just how it is"" cost me here or if it was a common experience with a good dealer

**I want to hear from the team of people that don't want to support these guys, and those that will bite the ethical dilemma to get what's in their best interest regardless of that.**

**TLDR:** First time buyer caught dealership increasing the cost of extra items on the invoice to compensate after turning down gap insurance. Was okay with how much I talked them down to at the time and agreed before leaving, but having doubts about the experience before finalizing. 

EDIT: Adding important details I missed!

* No I don't have the final paperwork yet- they merely gave me the itemized invoice, got my signature, and I'm assuming that's just an issuing of my word more than an actual sealed deal. They would not give me the interest rates when I asked. They insisted on negotiating monthly hard and I was flustered and unsure where to take the conversation in the moment. Verbiage at one point after I denied the offers was ""What can you afford? We'll do whatever we have to do to the numbers to make it work for you"" When I asked how exactly they'd make it work it wasn't made clear and he was off to finance. (\*Note above that I've now learned this was bad, mmkay)

* I wouldn't be buying the car if I didn't have to unfortunately, if I had any cash I'd definitely be making the repairs I need to get my current car's registration back in order. My dead 2011 Honda CRV has been reliable since I got it at 157,000, now at 215,700 miles but I just can't swing it unless financing car repairs was a thing, cause I'd so rather not get into more debt. It needs at least $1,500 to $2,000 before it can get a clear inspection, registered in my name, and back on the road.
* My credit is terrible right now - 590. I know expect a buttload of interest and it's unfortunately all I can do as I've just now gotten a stable job and am just building a life that isn't paycheck to paycheck now. 
   * My utilization is 92% right now, but my history of monthly payments is 100%, no derogatory marks, credit age average 11mos (first credit card established a little over 2 years ago) with five open accounts.
* Why I'm paycheck to paycheck: I basically worked an internship for seven years at a company I loved but moved on once I developed the skills and the economy's sense of urgency in me finding a better paying job. It was a trade-off of living the dream poor while also learning skills that would benefit me long term, which some would equate to a college education. 
   * I'm still living paycheck to paycheck but am proud of my fetal $200 emergency fund right now and am trying to make a habit of learning more about finance on Youtube at this time. ",2024-06-03 00:06:13,0.0,23.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,NW Mutual Financial Advisor...Starting to get cold feet,"To preface, a coworker recommended a friend of his for financial advice when I ran into some questions. I am starting to get cold feet on the prospect of paying 1.75% management fee to manage my finances. What I feel like I really needed was some advice now to make some moves (which he has given).

Questions I have:

A: Against most people here and videos online, I still dont understand the argument that permanent life insurance being used as an alternative to bonds is a bad idea?

B: Shouldnt I be putting about 1/3 of investments/retirement into bonds or safer securities?

C: Once I balance the allocation of my money across the market smartly for my age and have a good ratio, what else do I really need that deserves 1.75% every year in management fees? Seems like the value for his services if high for this initial setup but WAY less so as the years go on.

D: Can someone take a look at the below plan and offer some feedback/advice that is for or against the plan below?

Some facts about me to paint the picture for further detail:

1. 19 years in the Navy (enlisted not officer). Retiring @ 22 years.

Reddit,Accountable,401k v Roth for low income close to retirement,"Family friend ask me to review their 401k as another set of eyes - they are 62 (spouse 68) with 110k account balance split between a traditional and Roth.

Not only does it have a fitness room, a game room, central air, and an in unit laundromat, it also has EV charging (according to the site), which could help facilitate EV ownership in Quincy, given Quincy's lack of commitment to installing EV chargers, unlike Cambridge.

I could even afford some of the newer builds in Cambridge, even in Kendall for $3k but wanted to save money, so I instead decided to settle with Neponset Landing. It was also built I'm 2007, of which I believe would have vastly superior insulation than my Cambridge box from 1905.

I also visited Highlands at Faxon which supposedly costs around $2100 for 800 sqft and there is every amenity you can think of:

Proximity to Walmart/HMart/KanMan, 2 mi away from QC MBTA (I could easily bike 2 mi), free resident parking, fitness and game rooms, carpet removal, an in unit laundromat, balcony, kitchen, etc. However, there is no EV charging solution.

Even though I feel like Cambridge is more viable and I have 3-4k to spend on Cambridge rent, due to the fact I am hybrid, I decided to save a few thousand by shelling out in Quincy.

My relatives however, wanted me to buy a condo or a straight up single house because it would appreciate. However, given the high interest rates, would it be worth it to put down 100k on a 320k 650 sqft condo built in 1972 (not 2002 or 2007) and pay about $2268 a month (after accounting for HOA of $426 a month)? Based on my rent estimates for this house, it is somewhere between 1700 and 2000 (ironically, another unit in the same apartment is asking for $2000 rent). Is it worth buying or renting at this point?",2024-11-08 05:48:17,0.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,After tax 401k contributions / general account allocation,"My employer offers both pre and post tax 401k, in which I've been using the last two years.

Reddit,Accountable,How do I know if a debt collector is legit?,"Hello everyone!

I recently made a post about receiving an email saying I owed debt. I called the hospital to see if it was true, and they confirmed it. They told me they sent it to a debt collector, and I'd have to talk with them. There's a bit more to it, but that's the basic gist. My new issue is that I'm not sure if I should even trust these guys at all. I've never been in debt before, so I don't know how to handle debt collectors and things of that nature. I googled the company and found that there were a lot of reviews about them, essentially saying that they're scammers.

 I had called them because the hospital told me to get information. The lady on the phone was nice; however, she didn't know much about how much I owed and said that my account was merged with my father's, so they couldn't tell me how much I exactly owed until they could set up my own account. I was with my father whenever I was doing this call because he had claimed that my mother was resolving her debt through them as well. I thought everything was okay, and my dad was assuring me that it was, so they asked for some of my personal information, like my social security number, address, and things of that nature, so they could set up my own account and basically separate my bills from my father's bills. Before this, I had made sure to confirm through EOB statements and my own bank statements that the visits were real and that I hadn't paid them, at least from what my bank statement stated. So I gave them my information; they kept asking me if I accepted all of the debt, and I told them that I wanted to receive, like, a letter of some sort of just everything that was on my account that they were claiming was mine to make sure that they weren't putting anything that was my dad's on my account and all of that, and once I looked at that, then I would tell them whether I accepted it or not, because I just wanted to double-check. 

They told me that that was fine, that they were closing soon, and that they would call me back the following week (II called on a Friday afternoon, and they said they'd call me on Monday). I waited for a call. I received none, and now I'm on week two of basically just waiting for them to call me back. I don't know if I should trust them still; as I stated in my previous post, I wasn't aware of these medical charges at all. I wasn't given any letters, emails, or calls from the hospital at all that these charges were on my account. 

My husband and I are doing rather well right now. I just graduated from college, and I'm getting some certification so that I can get a job, so I really don't want to mess up my future when it's barely starting. I trusted my father, but it seems that every time I trust him, it doesn't go very well, and the claim that my mother was resolving her debt through them isn't very comforting either. She's been a victim of a lot of scams as well that I had to help her get out of and just help her resolve in general. I feel rather stupid that I gave them my information, and I've been keeping an eye on my credit score to see if there's been any marks on that, and I'm just really worried. We don't make a lot of money, so I don't know if I can even afford an attorney if the debt collectors decide to go that route, and I live in a small town, so I don't even know if there's any attorneys that cover this kind of stuff around here. 

I'm sorry for my rambling again; I just don't want to go into the same lifestyle that my parents created for themselves when I was little. I saw how that went, and I see how they are now, and I don't want to be like that. I can give the collection agency's name if you guys need, and I'll try to provide as much information in the comments as I can. I'm going to be calling them back today to see what's going on. I appreciate any of the advice and help that I get from here. I don't really have many reliable people in my life to get advice from, and the people at the hospital and the debt collection agencies just kind of treat me like I'm an absolute idiot for asking any questions about how this happened or how it came about.  ",2024-10-28 14:10:11,0.0,3.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Quickbooks Alternative for Personal Finances,"I used to be a small business owner and set up Quickbooks for both the Business as well as another account for Household Finances.

I mainly use it as a glamorized check register.

Reddit,Accountable,Will my diversification strategy for purchase of mutual funds ease the pain of dividends and capital gains on my taxes?,"Hello all, asking this question because my wife and I we took a bit hit on our Federal taxes in 2023 due to having to report Dividends/Capital Gains as earned income **(I do reinvest all my dividends**).  We had to report about $8,000 in Div/CG’s, and ending up owing 4K on our taxes…really due to this.  I know that is not the worst thing in the world – but it stung because the overall value of the investment account did not really increase. (My FIL is also a financial advisor, but objectively has not done a good job with this investment account of about $270K, so he **will** **\~not\~** \~be\~ involved in my current situation as outlined below). 

So recently, I inherited about $400K recently due the passing of my Aunt.  I am going to keep about $150K of it “safe” by putting it in a few HYSA’s (2 for my kids), and also into a 6-mo. CD which I can rollover.  So that leaves me about $250K to invest, and of course I am looking to maximize account value while minimizing potential hits on Div/CG’s.  I have researched about 20 top-performing mutual funds with Fidelity (**I like their funds and am planning on setting up the new brokerage account with them**)…so again am looking at 20 or so funds to spread across different sectors/concentrations.  These funds all have good YTD performance as well as nice gains over 1/5/10 yr. periods.  A few examples:

* FXAIX (S&P)
* FDSVX (Growth)
* FSPSX (International)
* FSENX (Energy)  
* FCPVX (Small cap)
* FSELX (Semi-conductors, technology), etc…

So if I just use some round #’s, if I invested equally in the 20 funds that would be about $13K/per fund.  (This is of course will not be the ultimate distribution).  My thinking is along these lines; If I stick to $13K and eg, buy 70 shares of FXAIX @$187, that limits my amount of shares and will mitigate some of the DIV/CG’s per share, which sit at about 0.55/0.12 respectively, as of last quarterly distribution.  Not bad #’s at all in terms of a potential tax hit if I have this amount of shares.  Ideally of course I would throw like $50K at an S&P fund as we know how well the S&P has performed historically – but again I’m thinking about the Div/CG’s hits.

If you look at a Growth fund like FDSVX which is booming this year, their Div/CG split per share is even more palatable (0.01/0.05 respectively last quarter…but has been more prohibitive in past payouts), so I might look to throw more $$ at that fund. 

The Small Cap funds of course usually pay less dividends as they reinvest in the company.  I’ll also have some $$ in bond funds and money market funds which are non-taxable.

So overall, I guess I am seeing if spreading it out over multiple funds...thus gaining exposure while limiting Div/CG’s due due to less shares in each - is a good strategy?  Or am I placing to much emphasis on the tax hits due to the Div/CG’s?  My wife also just claimed “0” on her withholdings (from 1) which will help mitigate some of this.  But again, keep in mind I will be receiving Div/CG’s from both the existing $270K investment account, and the new $250K brokerage account I am setting up.  I am open to any other investment strategy, including just keeping it in a few funds (please recommend).  My concern there would be diversification, the Div/CG's hit, and if the U.S. market takes an unexpected hit, etc.. 

Thanks for your review and advice.  Happy to answer any other ??’s.  I am 53 BTW, kids are going to college in 5-7 years so I am treating “some” of this new investment like a 529b if I can grow it better.

Reddit,Accountable,TOA. Betterment to Fidelity.,"Hi - seeking advice on how to approach and manage a situation. 

I recently completed a TOA (transfer of assets) from Betterment into fidelity and noticed the cost basis reported in fidelity includes share purchases that occured 3 years prior to the creation of that specific betterment goal.  That betterment goal was only ever funded with cash, was created in 2023, and the cost basis reported in fidelity shows ITOT purchases from 2020 when the market crashed. I am worried my cost basis is significantly understated, thus increasing my tax liability.

I reached out to Fidelity and they said they can't do anything. They said that I can manually update my cost basis, however I have weekly purchases dating back to 2018 and it will be impossible to manually update all purchases and positions. I am transferring 5 other accounts, fully closing out my betterment position, and some of those accounts were created in 2018. It's hundreds of thousands of $ and I am now worried betterment is incorrectly stating my cost basis across all accounts and positions. I only noticed this specific issue with ITOT because it was obviously before the creation of the specific goal. 

I have submitted a support ticket with betterment to review as well and am waiting on a response. Is there anything else I can do ?

Reddit,Accountable,Escrow minimum balance? Money back?,"It was determined that my escrow account on my mortgage is around $2,400 short for the year. The thing is my insurance and taxes did not increase by that amount although they did increase some. This caused my mortgage payment to increase around $300 a month. They are calculating a worst case minimum account balance to determine the cushion needed to cover everything as well. See their explanation below. 

Will I get money back or reduced off of a future escrow if the amount they predict is over what needs to be covered? Seems like there's added cushion in the account to not just cover costs but extra. This is my first mortgage so I've not had to deal with this before.

**FROM LENDER (COPIED FROM ESCROW STATEMENT)**  
HERE’S HOW WE CALCULATE ESCROW AMOUNTS: Escrow is kind of like a savings account - you add money to it and we use that money to make your taxes and insurance payments throughout the coming year. Here's how: First, we review the escrow payments we received from you and the tax and insurance items paid on your behalf during the past year. Second, we determine if your monthly escrow payment needs to change for the coming year. To do this, we estimate the next year’s tax and insurance items (excluding mortgage insurance) that we will pay on your behalf, plus the cash reserve† amount. We then divide the projected total by 12 to get your new monthly escrow payment. Then, with your new monthly escrow payment set, we project the monthly escrow account balances over the next year, on a month by month basis, to show what is coming in and what is going out. Finally, we compare the month with the lowest projected balance to the required minimum balance for that month to determine whether a shortage or surplus exists. The account histories on the following page show these steps in action! 

†*The cash reserve is also the minimum account balance. To calculate the cash reserve for the escrow account, we add up the total of your yearly escrow items (excluding mortgage insurance) and divide the total by 12. We take this amount and multiply it by 2, as allowed by state laws and/or the mortgage contract, to determine the total cash reserve. Maintaining a cash reserve helps to cover any unexpected increases in taxes and/or insurance.*",2024-10-23 16:16:14,2.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Hospital never sent me a bill but sent me to a collection,"After receiving over $2000 bills for pathology over cancer scare, and being told that my account was about to go to collections, I decided to call a hospital (in-network) to see if I have any bills that I owe but have not received bills until now. Turned out, I had over $10k that I owe and said one of my accounts (service from January this year) went so ""bad"" ($1500) that it got sent to collections. I have always been on top of my medical bills and I never knew of this bill. The only thing I remember is receiving EOB with a copay of $30, which I already paid. When I asked them to recall the debt from collections, they said they cannot since it was sent over a month ago. When I checked my credit report, however, I do not see any collection account on there nor did I receive any notice from the collections agency. What's going on?? 

Also, the insurance had been requesting medical records from the provider to determine the coverage, but the provider never replied which led to the claims being denied. When I called the hospital, they said ""well the letter only said 'send comprehensive medical records' and they didn't provide the dates of service, so we didn't send it."" And never responded to an insurance company or never alerted me. 
I submitted the release form a week ago, so hopefully insurance will receive it and review my case again, but in the mean time, is there anything I can do about the bills that somehow ended up in collections? 

Of course, I requested the itemized bills, and now my bill went down from $10k to $6k, but still that's a lot.

I feel like all of this was hospital's fault, because they never released or responded to the records request, and just sent me to collections before sending bills.

My new employer uses HealthEquity as our HSA provider and it’s been a nightmare. I’ve always used a high deductible healthcare plan and HSA to save on taxes. None of the other providers had issues like HealthEquity (HE). 

About 30 days ago I requested a reimbursement of about $1000, and selected for the money to be sent to my Chase checking account, which was already verified. Despite numerous attempts to resolve this issue through their customer service department, including spending countless hours on the phone, I have yet to receive my funds, and I have been provided no meaningful resolution.

As my frustrations grew, I researched the company and found they have 1.04 stars (out of five) on the BBB website. Many reviewers have experienced the same issues dating as far back as last year. 

HE has cited various reasons for the delays, including a recent claim of a “glitch” in their system. However, these excuses have done nothing to resolve the situation, and I am still without the funds owed to me. It’s been a huge waste of my time. 

There has to be some accountability when an HSA providers consistently has issues preventing consumers from accessing their money. I’ve contacted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the BBB, but I’m not sure how much it will help.

The bank reached out to me and said: 

>Premier checking no longer offers a return dividend, but During a recent review of your account, we noticed that you could be making more on the funds that you already have with us.

Why not lock in that high rate?  Our **High Yield savings gives 14.00% APY** on any amount deposited, up to $1000. **Money Market holds an APY of 1.10%** for balances over $2000 too.

What would be my best option for housing this money? I'm not too familiar with CDs, High Yield Savings or Money Markets to know the short term long term impacts of either. I really don't need access to it, so I wouldn't mind seeing it grow. I suppose I wouldn't want to lock it up forever, as someday I may need access to it, but it's been there for 4 years and I haven't needed it, so it's safe to say I probably could consider some long term storage/growth option.

Reddit,Accountable,Is there an institution that offers i401ks that allow me to instantly transfer and purchase mutual funds / etfs?,"I'm so frustrated. I started my own business and want to setup individual 401ks and contribute to my retirement. I've been with Vanguard for my Roth IRA for a long time, so I set up an individual 401k with them. A month later they let me know they are selling off this portion of their business to some no name company. So I decided to choose a new institution. 

  
I chose Charles Schwab, as they offered i401ks and seem to have great reviews. A bunch of a paper work and transfers later, and I'm set up. But now i'm realizing that their transfer system is ridiculous for i401ks. With vanguard, i can do one simple form: I choose the account I want to transfer from, the amount, the fund, employer or employee, and boom its initiated and its done. One time thing.

  
With Schwab, I can't move money from my US bank checking to the i401k. They said I have to move it to an internal account with them. So I open a brokerage account there, and make the transfer. But then there is a 3 day hold on the money for it to clear. And then, when I want to make the trade, I have to open a chat with them to transfer the money to the i401k. i'm guessing this is to specify the employer / employee contribution. then I can make my transaction.

  
With contributing to this account 1-2 times a month, and not being able to automate this, I'm realizing how much of a pain in the ass this will be. A multiple step, multi day thing for a single fucking transfer. Ridiculous. Absolutely hate it.

Reddit,Accountable,Single mom with tax debt needs sage advice ,"HELP! I have to pay off a $30,000 IRS settlement for back taxes in 4 months. This was negotiated down with an attorney from a much higher, scarier number. I was financially illiterate and reckless for most of my 20’s alongside my ex-partner. It’s a daunting number for me to attack so quickly, any advice on the least expensive way for me to do this would be greatly appreciated. 

I have roughly 8.5K monthly income after taxes, we live in a hcol city so bare essential living expenses are 4K. I work two jobs and freelance gigs when possible as a single mom. 

I have 12.5K total cc limit over 4 cards which I pay off in full monthly. 740-750 credit. My AMEX blue cash (6k limit) is still under intro 0% apr until March 2025. I also have Chase Freedom Flex (2k limit) Apple Card (2k limit) and Capital one Savor (2.5K limit). These were all opened in the last 24 months and last 3 are due for a line increase request. 

I figure I can realistically save $4K/month for the next 4 months so $16K should be accounted for. But there’s still the other half. 

I’d like to utilize my credit profile to get 15K interest free with a new 0% apr card and requesting a credit increase from Amex. I’d pay off the card with soonest ending 0% till I hit 0.

AMEX is my best bet since I’ve used the card heavily, paid in full, and in turn they’ve been generous with me early on. They increased me last week 3 > 6k without requesting. At the 91 day mark, would it be reasonable to ask for 3x, to an 18k limit? That would cover the last half all on one card which would be simple. 

Another option is AMEX Blue business cash card, 12 months 0% apr, but it’s a gamble getting a new card on my profile just for this debt without knowing what kind of limit they’d give me. It would be nice to have a little breathing room and would allow me to spend more time with my kiddo since I’ve been a slave to my jobs for the past few months. One issue is this tax settlement is public record and I’m worried that might affect my chances of getting approved. The tax debt isn’t on my credit profile, but IRS hard pulled my credit when the settlement was being reviewed. 

Last resort would be maxing out my cards in order of 0 - highest apr, and paying them off as quickly as possible in 4-6 months. 

Is there another option I’m not seeing?",2024-06-18 20:16:10,1.0,16.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

Reddit,Accountable,Best Spending Tracking Apps,"Hey all,
I'm planning to ha e me and my wife track every dollar as it's spent for one year from January to December in 2025. Basically everything we buy something anywhere whether we use credit, debit or cash, I'd ideally like us to go to an app and be able to throw it in and maybe put it under a category.

I know an excel spreadsheet can do it but is there anything more slick that one is free or has a subscription for exportable data?

My plan is to use this data to track what we truly spend in a year and where it goes. We save and invest a lot, but it would be nice to know what exactly is spent and where.

I tried following credit card statements jut it gets confusing with the way it shows up and doesn't show the whole picture with house and utilities and cash payments to workers or contractors.",2024-09-07 00:32:37,3.0,6.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Managing a windfall!,"

I recently received a windfall of $1 million (net). I am in a strong financial position currently and have been managing things on my own, but would like feedback on some details of allocating and investing this windfall. I have considered (and interviewed) a few financial advisors but can’t get myself to justify the expense, even for a fee-only it seems to be around $4k for a review of circumstances. I have enrolled in PlanVision ($300, primarily DIY but with use of eMoney and some but minor CFP input) but haven’t yet had my first meeting.

Circumstances: I am finishing medical residency, so my income is ~$80k/yr, household income $140k. Income will be $450k in 2 years. Our expenses are currently greater than our income, which was a conscious choice given the unique finances of physician training, and being able to have enough cash in HYSA to give ourselves plenty of runway. However given these circumstances, haven’t been able to maximize retirement accounts, and would like to especially now. 

My question is particularly with regards to this. Between work and IRA, spouse and I can put away $92k a year deducted from our paychecks (+ additional Roth IRA). Also plan to put max contribution into 529s that is state income tax deductible. How would you manage these retirement account contributions over the next two years? I was thinking to keep $200k in HYSA, maximize payroll deductions, and then just replace our allocated payroll from this $200k. I then have $200k slowly depleted sitting in a HYSA for 2 years, which isn’t the best use, but figure is also a hedge against our upside down circumstances and ultimately worth it to maximize the retirement contributions. Is this how you would get the money into tax advantaged accounts over the next two years, or is there something else I might consider?

Otherwise we are adequately insured in all regards, have basic estate planning, adequate emergency fund (plus will beef up our runway). The other question is should we set aside additional cash for a possible move. We own a house, and intend to stay there through the end of residency training, but circumstances may change such that we want to move. We’d likely plan to rent at first given it’d be a new job / new city, but might be somewhere we know in which case we’d consider buying. I figure though even in this circumstance, will have some cash on hand, can always purchase contingent on sale of my home, or just elect for physician mortgage with 0% down. It’s tempting to hold more in HYSA for these possible circumstances, I don’t want to go too gung ho putting the money to work, but this plan seems like a good balance of both. Thoughts?

Reddit,Accountable,"Fully disabled family member, recent windfall, about to meet with ""financial advisors"", need advice","I have a family member who just received a windfall of around $160k and needs to make it last. He is a brain cancer survivor (more than a decade now), but in declining health and completely unable to work. He's able to care for himself for now, but his prognosis doesn't extend much past the next 10 years or so.

He called me this afternoon to talk about investments. He has already met with JP Morgan — who recommended what sounds like an immediate annuity — and is meeting with Chase next week. My immediate advice was A) everyone you're talking to is a sales person and is lining you up with products that they get paid to sell you, and B) **do not** make any decisions until we have reviewed all the fine print.

My investment knowledge is entirely focused on my circumstance (middle 40s, high-income, retirement-ready), so I'm not terribly well equipped to advise someone who basically needs retirement income now.

He has no other assets, and only social security income which will cover his rent and nothing more. I think he has way overshot the mark in his estimation of what can be achieved with $160k. He says he needs $900 per month in income ($10,800 per year) from this $160k. That's a withdrawal rate of 6.75%, which is well beyond the safe withdrawal rate of 3-4% that is in line with consensus.

I told him not to take the meeting, but he's insisting on going. He did agree not to make any decisions while he is there. I've asked him to get the specific details of all financial products they're recommending, which we will shop against offerings from Vanguard and Fidelity.

I'm looking for any and all advice here, from general to specific. He definitely wants help, but he's taking some convincing. In a 30 minute phone call he went from ""I don't like online banks"" to ""I'm going to open an Ally account and get this money in there"". He just has a lot of outdated misconceptions, but he seems willing to listen.",2024-03-26 22:40:55,22.0,23.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,What to do with a mandatory pension lump sum distribution?,"Basically, I got a letter from my old employer's pension plan that the estimated value of my pension was below a specific amount outlined in their plan, so they are either going to roll it over to a specific company (which sounds awful based on reviews online) if they don't hear from me, or I can provide them with information to rollover the funds into an IRA or employer plan of my choosing. The amount is roughly $4,500, so it isn't anything significant, but not nothing either.

Basically, I'd like to get this money into an account that will at least see some growth but which I can be mostly hands off with, but I have no idea how to accomplish that. Can I/should I put these funds into a traditional IRA with Fidelity? Can I/should I rollover these funds into my current employer's 401K? It sounds like I can do a direct rollover from the pension but that they will send me the check with the payee listed as whoever I tell them in the paperwork.

Reddit,Accountable,Is a fixed index annuity a good idea as a part of retirement strategy for a 40 year old?,"I spoke with a financial advisor to review my retirement accounts and provide suggestions for how to best set them up for success. The only change suggested was to move my current annuity to a new one with a different provider but I'm concerned about two things (1) that an annuity is the right way to go and (2) that this annuity with a 10 year lock-in is a good one. While the idea of an annuity was to add a more secure mix to the slate of areas where retirement money is being placed, I'm not sure this one is the best with the 10 year lock and 55% participation rate, especially if it ends up not performing as expected.  
  
Here's a breakdown of where I stand: 

* company 401k at about $90k with regular 8% contribution
* secondary 401k with no current contributions at about $40k
* fixed index annuity - cap 5%, 100% participation rate, follows S&P 500; averages 2.5%

Suggested changes

* move to [F&G Power Accumulator 10](https://success.fglife.com/hubfs/Annuity_emails/Annuity_Product_News/Power%20Accumulator/ADV2092%20FG%20Power%20Accumulator%2010%20%28AAG%29%20iSHARES%2019-0560%20-%2020191008_1PROOF.pdf)
   * 10 year lock - penalties for any changes before 10 years 
      * year 1 - 9%
      * year 3 - 8%
      * years 4-10 - reduces by 1% to 1% at year 10)
   * 55% participation rate\*
   * one year point-to-point with par
   * no cap
   * follows S&P 500 ETF
* later, review the secondary 401k to decide what should be done with it

\*not sure on the 55% participation rate. This is what the fine print mentions:  
*The Index Credits for the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF® (EFA) One-Year Point-to-Point with Par option are calculated and credited only on an Index Crediting date by using a formula that considers the beginning and ending values of the iShares MSC! EAFE ETF® (EFA) for a One-Year Index Crediting Period. The Participation Rate limits how much of any increase will be used to calculate any Index Credits. The Participation Rate is declared prior to each One-Year Index Crediting Period. We determine the index percentage change by subtracting the ETF Value at the beginning of the One-Year Index Crediting Period from the ETF Value at the end of the One-Year Index Crediting Period and then divide that value by theETF Value at the beginning of the One-Year Index Crediting Period and then multiplied by the Participation Rate. The current Participation Rate is 60% for this option. The Participation Rate will never be less than 20% for this option. If the index percentage change is zero or negative, no index interest is added. If the index percentage change multiplied by the Participation Rate is positive, this percentage is multiplied by the option's Account Value to determine the Index Credits. The Index Credits pursuant to this option will never be less than zero.*

Reddit,Accountable,"Should I be putting more of my income into Stocks and bonds, Trad IRA, or 401k?","I currently have an Acorns account with about $4,000 invested total. Around $3k of that is in stocks and bonds and the rest is in an Acorns traditional IRA. I put around $180/month into the stocks and bonds and $60/month into the IRA. I will continue doing this for the foreseeable future. I plan on not touching any of this money until retirement. My question is not whether I should be using Acorns or not because I know there are mixed reviews about it. I should also say I don’t really know much about investing and such, obviously.

I also put around $220/month into the 401k at my work. It comes out to about 10% of my monthly income that goes into this account.

So clearly I put more money into the Acorns accounts. Like I said, I plan on not touching any of this until retirement. I want this money to grow with compound interest over many years.

Reddit,Accountable,Loan for CC Debt (personal vs 401k),"Looking for advice on how to handle my credit card debt and whether or not I should apply for a person loan, 401k loan, or leave everything as is. 

11k credit card debt between two cards. 
4k on Chase @ 27.99% interest. ~$150 minimum payment 
7k on Discover @ 23.24% interest ~$175 minimum payment

Obviously I’ve been spending more that what I have, and things have snow balled. I prioritized saving for a while, but things happened and now my savings/emergency fund is just about gone. 
Not having much of a savings account has been stressing me out. I’m considering consolidating my debt with something with less interest, so I can focus on building my emergency back up. My husband also has similar debt and saving situation, so it makes sense to me that atleast one of us should be putting away in case the worst happens. 

Discover is offering 17% interest (seems high to me) and USAA is advertising 11%, so my guess it will be somewhere between 11-17% (haven’t applied/pulled credit yet)

Recently learned about 401k loan, which I can get for 10k but have heard mixed reviews. I don’t see myself staying with my current company for the next 5 years, so paying it back is a concern for me. But have heard interest is low.

Regardless of either option, I’d still work to reduce this debt. There may be some months I can just pay the monthly and others I can put more towards getting it down. My goal is to feel like I’m in a more stable place and prepared incase we have an emergency… I don’t want to have to rely on yet another credit card (which has clearly burned me in the past)  ",2024-08-15 02:30:43,0.0,8.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

For example if you were to get audited would the IRS want to review all those accounts and their transactions to verify there was not illicit activity or unpaid taxes?

Or if you plan on buying a home one day will a bunch of old bank account complicate your finances and make it harder to show proof of funds?

All financial institutions are required to keep your information for 7 years so there will be a record for all those opened and closed bank accounts which I feel complicates your financial history.

Due to my interest in /r/personalfinance/ I feel somewhat overprepared for this situation, although I've never been in it before (I'm 41, and if I've ever ended a position at a job it was my own choice).

What I'd like to do is come away from this discussion with a ""just laid off checklist"" that keeps me organized during this period of transition, get some questions answered about severance, and some questions answered about unemployment.

**Financials/Info**

* 41 years old, married.
* Earned 135k gross in 2023, salary, tech industry, LCOL area. Earned $130k gross in 2022. ~4% raise annually was pretty standard.
* Contributed max to my 401k for the past X years, at least since 2018 per my google sheet. Back then when the max was $18500 that's what I contributed, and whenever the max got increased I increased my contributions to hit the new cap (was on course to contribute $23000 for 2024)
* $7k cash in my checking acct
* $62k cash in my savings acct
* $177k invested in a brokerage account
* $192k invested in a Roth IRA (have been contributing the max for X years also)
* $329k in 401k
* Spouse works making $80k gross but take home is closer to $55k (retirement contributions $20500 annually, benefits come out of spouse's paycheck for the two of us)
* Spouse's checking and savings are also flush, last time we reviewed our finances together (Jan 2024) my spouse had $93k between both her checking and savings.
* Spouse's brokerage account $158k
* Spouse's 403b $185k
* Spouse's Roth IRA $47k

**Monthly Budget**

* $1230 Mortgage Payment, have been putting $500 extra towards principal since we got the loan 10 years ago. $70k remaining balance on the loan at 4.4%. Payment includes $125/mo home insurance, which we change every 3-4 years to get lower rates and often better coverage.
* $80/mo high speed internet
* ~$150/mo gas+elec
* ~$40/mo water/sewer
* $225/mo groceries, includes meal prepped lunches around $8/each
* $70/mo pest control spray (canceled this)
* $120/mo phone/data, includes our aging parents lines
* $275/mo auto insurance, 2 vehicles, liability and collision
* $300/mo allowance for ""friday night date nights"" although we often are under that, sometimes we just stay in stream TV
* $300/mo allowance for ""carryout"" since we both work and neither of us want to cook all the time. Expect a shift in this as I walked to the corner grocery today with plans to cook and eat leftovers this week since I'm no longer employed
* $100/mo allowance for Stitch Fix wardrobe (get 1 shipment every 2 months, often keep 1-2 of 5 items). Planning to cancel this.
* $50/mo prescriptions
* $21/mo Hulu
* $15/mo Netflix
* $1/mo Apple 50GB cloud storage

**Things I've done already**

* Updated Resume with most recent experience, have had spouse and best friend review it
* Contacted about a dozen+ former colleagues and close friends also in the tech industry, make them aware of my situation and interest in securing full time work again
* Marked myself as open for work on LinkedIn, updated profile
* Contacted the last 2 local headhunters who reached out to me on LinkedIn with job opportunities. I have not had great experiences with headhunters overall but the best experiences I've had were the local ones.
* Received a response from a former colleague who linked me to open positions at his company, 3 of which look like appropriate salary range/skills for me. In talks with him about when I'll submit an application and if he'll stick his neck out for me with a personal recommendation.
* Printed hard copies of my 2023, 2022 W-2s
* Read over my severance agreement. Haven't signed yet. Unsure if it's necessary to discuss with a lawyer (a family member is a lawyer and would review this with me for free if necessary, but not sure it's necessary. Agreement seems to say ""by accepting this severance, you agree not to sue us, share industry secrets, or talk negatively about your experience working here"")
* Read over the unemployment info included in the packet. I was encouraged during my exit meeting to file for unemployment on 6/14 which is my official last day.

**Things I'm planning on doing**

* Cancel Netflix, or Hulu. We can live without both until I have a full time position again.
* File an unemployment claim. It's been since before COVID that I've job hunted, and I know from experience it's easier to find a well paying job when you're already employed. It's unclear to me how long this between jobs will be.
* Catch up on some household things (organization/declutterring, mostly, as neither cost money and I never seem to have the energy when I'm working)
* Make a conscious effort to get healthier and/or lose weight (working in IT I sit for long periods at a computer and I've gotten big. according to my doctor I was 190lbs in 2017 and I'm closer to 250lbs now).

**Things I have questions about**

* What's the one paragraph summary of unemployment, especially if you know about unemployment in Michigan? My understanding is you file for it, it takes some time to get approved, you must do regular check ins indicating you're looking for work to keep it, and it can take just as long to stop it as start it so expect to send your last unemployment check back? It's new territory for me, any info is appreciated.
* If I have access to a free lawyer for a look over my severance agreement that I must sign in and turn in within a month to receive the severance, is it worth doing? What are the most common ""gotchas"" that I'd need to look out for in these types of agreements. In my mind, the things to look out for are 1) if there's any non-compete agreement in there saying I can't work in the same industry or for a competitor for X amount of time (there isn't) or 2) if there's something inside indicating I'm resigning and won't be entitled to unemployment (there isn't).

If you made it all the way through all this I appreciate you. Thanks for your help.",2024-06-12 16:21:02,17.0,13.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Input or Reviews for Accounting / Bookkeeping / Business Finance software,"*Hi All!*

This is crossposted from r/selfhosted because I would prefer to go that route, however I'm also open to regular software that is paid, if it is on-prem and not extortionate on pricing.

I'm looking for new **Accounting / Bookkeeping / Business Finance software** and wanting some input from people with experience in the open-source and/or self-hosted options.  This thread is a bit long, but the goal is to be detailed and get good feedback.  I hope it helps me, and also serves as a helpful resource in the future for other people!

Let me start by saying I have searched and browsed this and other subreddits, and read the list at https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#money-budgeting--management

I don't mind going a bit overkill and installing an ERP system, if the accounting portion does what I need it to do.

I also don't mind paying a reasonable price for software that suits my needs, I'm just tired of being extorted by QuickBooks.  Truthfully, QuickBooks Desktop is fine in every regard except that they took away the ability to import bank statements and automatically match/reconcile transactions on the older versions.  So, now I'm looking for something new.  Also, cloud/remote access would definitely be useful for my business, but it really isn't a NEED.

I have browsed features and/or documentation, and/or demoed most things below.  Notes regarding my findings and observations will be added on most of the software.

**Personal Requirements of the Software:**

* Cash-basis accounting (but should also be able to do accrual, for other businesses)
* Item lists
   * Inventory items (where it tracks inventory, and costs, taxes, etc.)
   * Non-inventory items (no on-hand, cost, or taxation tracking - just keep a list and customer price)
   * Services
* Good invoicing capabilities, templates, etc.
* Sales tax **per invoice** (not per item), hopefully even per customer or customer location like QuickBooks.  Many accounting packages made outside the US seem to have taxes per item, which gets tedious, when I need to charge based on sale location (Manager.io has this issue)
* Import from bank statements on csv, qbo, qif, whatever, for income and expenses
* Easy matching / reconcile transactions by name on import, automatic for frequent vendors after programming name to name, etc.  Basically QuickBooks Bank Feeds, even if it works a little different.

**Things I don't need or care about:**

* AUTOMATIC import from/linking to bank accounts (I don't mind doing this manually and, for security and reliability, would almost prefer this.)
* Modern interface.  I want the product to be intuitive to use, but I really don't care what it looks like.

**Cloud Options I've found (Self-Host):**

* ERPNext / FrappeBooks
* Dolibarr
* EspoCRM
* LedgerSMB
* Flectra
* SQL-Ledger
* BigCapital
* FrontAccounting
* Firefly iii
* Apache OFBiz
* Tryton
* InvoiceNinja
* Idempiere / Adempiere / Compiere
* InvoicePlane

**Installable options I've found (Local):**

* [manager.io](http://manager.io)
* GnuCash

**The EASY answer is probably:**

* InvoiceNinja front end, [manager.io](http://manager.io) for the rest of the accounting

InvoiceNinja seems great.  Invoices look good, and it does sales tax the way I need it.  However, it doesn't do accounting.  [manager.io](http://manager.io) seems to work well enough for accounting, but the invoices are an issue because sales taxes are per-item.  That is far too tedious for me, because I need to charge sales tax based on sale location.

However, I would prefer to keep everything in one software if at all possible.

**Maybe a good fit:**

For all of these, I'm just not sure if the bank feeds and/or invoices are good enough.  It hasn't been that easy to figure out some of this in the available demos

* LedgerSMB
* SQL-Ledger
* FrontAccounting
* Flectra
* ERPNext / FrappeBooks
* Idempiere

**Not a good fit:**

* Akaunting
   * Pro: Basic accounting package seems to be good
   * Con: All additional ""apps"" are paid and fairly expensive once added up, even on self-hosted.  I need many of these such as Bank Feeds, Double Entry, Inventory, etc.
* Odoo
   * Most modules are paid; locked in at their mercy.
* Wave
   * Not self-hosted
   * Not double entry
   * Locked in at their mercy.
* BigCapital
   * Just doesn't seem mature enough yet
* GnuCash
   * All of these reasons:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/gnucash/comments/o4s1bx/im\_starting\_to\_see\_the\_serious\_limitations\_built/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnucash/comments/o4s1bx/im_starting_to_see_the_serious_limitations_built/)

**Haven't really been able to find much on:**

* Firefly iii
* Apache OFBiz
* Tryton

I am also cross-posting to a few other related subs for further reach:

Reddit,Accountable,"ISO software to help a team fill out online forms collaboratively, sharing comments and marking authorship","Hi there, I work for a nonprofit that's fortunate enough to have lots of grants and support from foundations and government entities. It's great, though one drawback is that we regularly have to fill out lots of very detailed forms reporting on what we did with our our donors' etc. money and what results we achieved. The forms vary widely in terms of both content and format, but they're almost all online fillable forms of some kind, whether coded bespoke, SurveyMonkey Apply, Salesforce Experience Cloud etc. etc. 

To fill these forms, we need our program managers to fill in some data, our finance and accounting folks to fill in others, our fundraising office to manage and check everything's in place, and our legal folks to review everyone else's work for compliance. Which gets a little tiresome when we're trying to fill out a multi-page google form that doesn't save your progress or allow you to move forward until you've answered all required questions on the page.

What we've done so far is ask some of our funders to send us word or pdf versions that we can work on together. About one-third are willing to do this, and often they accidentally don't match the live survey. So more often what we end up doing is copying down every question onto a shared spreadsheet with a column for: the question, the question type, if it's required, the answer choices, our answer, who on the team is supposed to answer it, and who on the team checked their answer and approved it. And that's the *simplified* version after I pointed out that Excel has a commenting feature built-in so we don't need dedicated columns for notes or discussion.

There's *got* to be a better way, right? Does anyone know of an app or piece of software that will allow us to, for example, annotate an online form in a way that marks who is annotating, edit annotations later, and reply to annotations as comments?

Thank you!",2024-05-02 17:28:30,3.0,5.0,software,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,I want to install and register WhatsApp on my PC.,"Now, I tried getting an android emulator, and everything was fine. I registered the account, and set it up. My sim was in another phone so I could get the sms message, blah, blah, blah. Then all of a sudden I got banned. They reviewed the ban, and allowed me in, but I ran into another issue. It said something about me using the official WhatsApp app.

After some excess research, I discovered that it's because of the google play device certificate. Now, I tried finding the ID, then going to googles website, adding the ID, registering, deleting storage on google play store, and all that hassle, and it still did not work. The device is still not certified.

I've tried this on Bluestacks as well. Nothing.

I also tried Windows Subsystem for Windows 10. I had to get it from GitHub, but it worked fine. I just don't like that version of WhatsApp, as it's a bit limited. It also registers your WhatsApp as a tablet and not a Phone. You also have to set it up on another device. You also cannot post on your status.

Is there any other way to do this?",2024-06-15 13:38:22,0.0,1.0,software,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Accountable,Are you with or against bots banning people on apps?,"For me personally, I am not fully against it, but the way I've seen it being used so far is not good at all. Countless people are randomly getting banned on WhatsApp for literally nothing. On r/whatsapp there's like a post 2-3 times per day of people getting banned. For spam, or any random thing. I don't know if it's a new user thing or a region based thing. Nobody in my area so far has had this issue except when they were actually using 3rd party addons and co.

I also got my instagram account banned and cannot make a new one with my email because of the bots flagged me for suspicious activity, and I didn't do anything about it because I wasn't using IG that much at that time. Now I'm perm banned, and cannot request a review of the decision. 

On Tiktok, I have limited features because I got flagged by bots flagging me for suspicious activity. I can't like, comment or even follow. And the worst part is, anytime I complain, their support is also handled by a bot. The reason this is happening is that, my sister created a tiktok account with my email, and I didn't know, so when I went on to tiktok with a different browser, I clicked on continue with google, and it worked. So maybe two accounts with one Gmail is sus, but the fact that no human reviewing it is very annoying. There is no fix to this, but just to wait. Some are lucky and in a week or two it works, others have this issue for up to a year.

I've personally never seen this used in a good way, and have never had a good experience with it. Have any of you had a good experience with these bots?

TL;DR Bots should be used alongside humans. Bots for flagging, humans for reviewing. boys aren't ready",2024-02-22 16:50:22,2.0,3.0,software,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,DATEV eG,Reasonable S Corp Salary for 7 Figure Business,"Hey all!

I am self employed (HR/Benefits) with an S corp. My business has really taken off and I'm now getting into the debate about what is reasonable salary at my income levels.

To give some history:

2019 - 140k gross with about 20k in expenses (80k as W2)

2020 - 275k gross with about 80k in expenses  (150k as W2)

2021 - 800k gross with about 110k in expenses (300k as W2)

2022 - 1.4 million gross with about 130k in expenses (400k as W2)

2023 - 1.9 million gross with about 140k in expenses (500k as W2)

2024 - 3.3 million with about 200k in expenses

My biggest customer is my uncle's business which generates about 90% of my revenue. I get the other 300k or so from 2 other customers. I also have no advanced degree, just a BA in art (lol).

Is 500k W2 still reasonable with 3.1 million net? I also am putting my husband on as a W2 employee at 250k since he does help out about 20 hours a week (he is also a personal trainer making around 30/hr). Not sure if this means real W2 is closer to 750k or not when thinking about ""reasonable salary""

I have researched this pretty extensively and I know it is up for debate, but my CPA want's me to do $1,000,000 as W2 which does not seem reasonable to me. I looked up HR positions in large companies, and many don't make even $500k, let alone a million. His argument is that taking too much as K1 (and getting QBI) may raise red flags and that he sees me as a ""Fractional Executive"" who often can make 7 figures in major corporations.

Does it help my argument or hurt it that my biggest customer is a family member and thus my relationship is arguably a huge component of my success?

I would just like some additional opinions since I hired an Enrolled Agent for a consult and she said even 500k is too high and she would do 150k, but that seemed uncomfortably low.

To be clear, I'm not really looking for an echo chamber. If $1,000,000 is reasonable, I am happy to do it, but before I pay an extra 100k in tax, I figured getting more input would be great.

Thank you in advance!

\*\*\*I do have 2 ""employees"" in the Philipines who help with basic paperwork and simple questions via email. They are not W2 or 1099, rather I just pay a company that pays them in the Philippines\*\*\*

My husband handles managing the phone system we designed and built for them (e.g. the phone tree, adding new employees, troubleshooting, etc.)

I pay my husband 250k because I want him to get more SS credits and to be able to contribute to a SEP IRA. I also figured it is better to have more in total W2 than K1 given my CPA's concerns.",2024-10-06 23:22:47,5.0,38.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,DATEV eG,IRS is still reviewing my amendment but also sent a letter asking to pay tax by 9/23,"I made a mistake on my 2022 tax return - didn’t include the student tax break. 
I figured it out fast and mailed the amendment within 3 weeks per IRS directions.
I was then told it would take up to 25 weeks to review. 
Long story short we are way past the 25 weeks and it’s still under the review. I used to call in and get a hold of the customer service rep who were useful as they were able to track the review process, identify errors on the IRS side (e.g., we didn’t have enough space to type your apartment number that’s why you weren’t receiving any correspondence).
So today I got a letter saying that I had to pay tax and penalties by 9/23. I am capable of paying but I can’t even express the frustration with them bc I don’t owe them any of that. I have paid my actual tax for that year, the amount their are mailing about is what I don’t owe them bc of the student tax break and the penalties for that amount. 
However, I no longer can get a hold of them. The number which worked previously for reaching them no longer works - ‘we can’t take your call, call again another day’.

Reddit,DATEV eG,Indiana state possible audit,"I received a letter from my states (Indiana) dept of revenue that basically sounds like an audit and I’m looking for some advice/guidance. For some background- I started a side business back in 2021 that receives 1099 income. My question is- what happens if I am unable to produce the proof of my business expenses? Or even the 1099 for that matter? I admittedly was majorly slacking on keeping documentation and records. I’m assuming they would throw out those “expenses” and then charge me taxes on what the income that those expenses offset? What if I’m not able to support ALL of the expenses but can some- so for example a mileage deduction: what if I can only show support for 75 percent of the mileage? Do they throw all of them out or only toss the 25 percent I was unable to prove? 
My side business is just starting and doesn’t make much money and after it was all said and done I claimed a 13k dollar loss on it and had approx. 7k in 1099 receipt for it. This was in addition to my approx. 170k w2 income. So I guess the side business lowered my agi by 13k but what if I can only prove that it should have lowered it only say 6k?

I'm a freelance (1099) tech consultant in California. I have one primary client that accounts for 95% of my income. I've reviewed the A-B-C test criteria that CA established under Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5) to distinguish independent contractors versus employees, and I'm fairly certain that I can pass all 3 standards, but i've recently been told by my client that they are hearing from their accountant/lawyer that CA is starting to match up freelance worker's SSN with the 1099s to identify and target businesses who may be in violation of the A-B-C standards. 

What can I do to strengthen my 1099 status and minimize the chances of my client being investigated (and possibly fined) for violating AB5? I've been operating as a sole proprietor for many years, but would it help to form an LLC at this point to create more of a business-to-business relationship? Or can I just apply for an EIN as a sole proprietor? Perhaps a new contract that explicitly states that I am not an employee but an independent contractor performing work that the company does not have internal staff capable of performing? 

And is there anything I can do at this point when filing my taxes for 2023 that I can retroactively use to help create more separation between my client and myself? (e.g. If I form an LLC or get an EIN now can I use that for my 2023 tax filing?",2024-02-26 21:12:22,2.0,7.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,DATEV eG,State Inventive vs. 30% Geothermal Tax Credit,"For context, we installed a geothermal system as a replacement for an aged AC in 2023, and we live in Massachusetts, which offers a hefty $15,000 incentive for what's called a 'whole-home' conversion to geothermal.

Where I have been truly confused is the total lack of clarify on how to handle the $15,000 incentive vis-a-vis Form 5695.  The $15,000 incentive is not guaranteed, is not offered by a party to the purchase, e.g. manufacturer or installer, does not affect the upfront purchase price in any way, and only delivered well after the fact, assuming a homeowner ultimately 'passes' the program's gauntlet of review and approval and actually gets the $$$ in the end.  [Great program but horrible execution, and it seems clear at least some homeowners 'give up' on trying to get an incentive they're genuinely owed.]

Additionally (and if we're at all typical), our $15,000 check took 8 months to be approved and sent, which means for many homeowners that project expenses will be incurred in one tax year. . . and a 'zero guarantee' incentive *might* show up the next fiscal year.

I note Form 5695, while it does appreciate the carryover credit from a previous year's form, does not seek to capture anything akin to 'incentive since received on any related work'.

It would seem very easy for the Form and its instructions to be very clear on this point, but they're not.  Is the incentive just set aside vis-a-vis the federal tax credit?

FYI, no tax form or letter of guidance sent from the state incentive program.

More academically, what are homeowners to do when their upfront costs occur in one tax year yet their incentive doesn't come through until the next tax year??

Reddit,DATEV eG,"30-Day Challenge #11: Audit your insurance coverage! (November, 2024)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Audit your insurance coverage!** How long has it been since you examined your coverage or gotten a quote from another company to look for cheaper insurance? As your life evolves, it's important to make sure you update your insurance coverage as well. This is also a good way to save some money if you can find a better deal for insurance elsewhere or if you find yourself overinsured in some specific area.

## Why insurance?

Insurance is an approach to handle the problem of *risk*. Most likely, during your life, one or more of these things will happen: you will be in a vehicle accident, you or someone close to you will experience serious illness or injury, or you will lose your job. Positive events have associated risk as well: ask anyone who has had a child, puppy, house, or marriage.

You can choose to *retain* each of those risks: decide that if the bad thing happens, you can afford to pay for it, to self-insure. For example, if you lose a laptop, you can buy another one. You can also *reduce* the risk, say, by not driving on icy streets or by having chains on your tires.  The other ways to deal with risk are to *avoid* it (don't buy a puppy) or *transfer* it (insurance!).

Most of us don’t think about risk until the bad thing happens. We are in a vehicle crash with an expensive car, someone is injured, and only then it dawns on us that we might be underinsured.

For many major risks, most people share the risk with an insurance company through various insurance products. If you own a vehicle, most likely you will be required by your state to have liability coverage (personal injuries and property damage caused by you). If you have a mortgage, your mortgage holder will require you to have homeowners insurance and some landlords will require renters insurance. Other types of insurance are optional, but may be desirable if available, for example, disability insurance.

## Audit your insurance coverage

Take a minute to think about what insurance coverage you currently have, whether you may be paying too much, and whether your coverage limits are appropriate:

* Car Insurance
* Health / Vision / Dental Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Homeowners / Renters Insurance
* Jewelry Insurance

Although insurance is an important financial tool to protect you against emergencies, it can also be a major drain on your budget. Insurance agents often use the fact that *some* insurance is important to make you feel that *the more insurance you have, the better off you are*.

It's wise to **only insure what you need to insure**. What do you need to insure? Anything that you could not easily afford to replace with your cash savings or where the loss would significantly set you back financially. In the next 30 days, review not only the types of insurance you have, but the level of coverage you have in each type. Here are some ideas for various types of insurance:

## Car Insurance

Assess all the types of coverage you have on your car. See the wiki article on [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance) for more details and ways to save money. For example, if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, call your insurance company and see if they provide a low-mileage discount.

Liability insurance is required by law if you drive and is very important: Would you be able to pay out a $300,000 lawsuit if you injure someone in a car accident? Liability insurance is not a great place to skimp.

Coverages for ""uninsured motorists"" (an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or your passengers) and ""medical payments"" (you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident) are also worth having. They are less expensive than liability coverage and the irresponsibility of others is a major risk.

Also consider whether your ""collision"" and ""comprehensive"" deductibles coverage is appropriate or necessary, especially if you have an older car or significant savings. Eliminating or reducing these types of coverage can reduce your insurance bill, but you'll be left on the hook to replace or repair your own car if you (or mother nature) damage it.

Finally, when you see car insurance advertisements selling you ""better car replacement"" or ""one model year newer"" insurance, realize that this is a **great** deal for the insurer and not as great for their customers. Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done two or more of the following things:

* Reviewed the coverage limits on each of your policies and read the associated wiki page.  (Making changes is up to you and not something you should do without doing more research and reading.  This challenge is only about reviewing your insurance.)
* Read more about a type of insurance that you don't currently have.
* Created an up-to-date home inventory of your belongings.
* Requested a quote from a different insurance company or inquired about potential discounts from your current insurance company.
* Read the policy document for at least one of your insurance policies (you should know which ""perils"" the insurance company covers and which are excluded).

Reddit,DATEV eG,Will my diversification strategy for purchase of mutual funds ease the pain of dividends and capital gains on my taxes?,"Hello all, asking this question because my wife and I we took a bit hit on our Federal taxes in 2023 due to having to report Dividends/Capital Gains as earned income **(I do reinvest all my dividends**).  We had to report about $8,000 in Div/CG’s, and ending up owing 4K on our taxes…really due to this.  I know that is not the worst thing in the world – but it stung because the overall value of the investment account did not really increase. (My FIL is also a financial advisor, but objectively has not done a good job with this investment account of about $270K, so he **will** **\~not\~** \~be\~ involved in my current situation as outlined below). 

So recently, I inherited about $400K recently due the passing of my Aunt.  I am going to keep about $150K of it “safe” by putting it in a few HYSA’s (2 for my kids), and also into a 6-mo. CD which I can rollover.  So that leaves me about $250K to invest, and of course I am looking to maximize account value while minimizing potential hits on Div/CG’s.  I have researched about 20 top-performing mutual funds with Fidelity (**I like their funds and am planning on setting up the new brokerage account with them**)…so again am looking at 20 or so funds to spread across different sectors/concentrations.  These funds all have good YTD performance as well as nice gains over 1/5/10 yr. periods.  A few examples:

* FXAIX (S&P)
* FDSVX (Growth)
* FSPSX (International)
* FSENX (Energy)  
* FCPVX (Small cap)
* FSELX (Semi-conductors, technology), etc…

So if I just use some round #’s, if I invested equally in the 20 funds that would be about $13K/per fund.  (This is of course will not be the ultimate distribution).  My thinking is along these lines; If I stick to $13K and eg, buy 70 shares of FXAIX @$187, that limits my amount of shares and will mitigate some of the DIV/CG’s per share, which sit at about 0.55/0.12 respectively, as of last quarterly distribution.  Not bad #’s at all in terms of a potential tax hit if I have this amount of shares.  Ideally of course I would throw like $50K at an S&P fund as we know how well the S&P has performed historically – but again I’m thinking about the Div/CG’s hits.

If you look at a Growth fund like FDSVX which is booming this year, their Div/CG split per share is even more palatable (0.01/0.05 respectively last quarter…but has been more prohibitive in past payouts), so I might look to throw more $$ at that fund. 

The Small Cap funds of course usually pay less dividends as they reinvest in the company.  I’ll also have some $$ in bond funds and money market funds which are non-taxable.

So overall, I guess I am seeing if spreading it out over multiple funds...thus gaining exposure while limiting Div/CG’s due due to less shares in each - is a good strategy?  Or am I placing to much emphasis on the tax hits due to the Div/CG’s?  My wife also just claimed “0” on her withholdings (from 1) which will help mitigate some of this.  But again, keep in mind I will be receiving Div/CG’s from both the existing $270K investment account, and the new $250K brokerage account I am setting up.  I am open to any other investment strategy, including just keeping it in a few funds (please recommend).  My concern there would be diversification, the Div/CG's hit, and if the U.S. market takes an unexpected hit, etc.. 

Thanks for your review and advice.  Happy to answer any other ??’s.  I am 53 BTW, kids are going to college in 5-7 years so I am treating “some” of this new investment like a 529b if I can grow it better.

Reddit,DATEV eG,Portfolio Review and Rollover Decision: Fidelity vs. Empower,"I’m in my early 20s and recently switched jobs. My previous employer used Fidelity for my 401(k), and my new employer uses Empower. I just found out that my new employer does not support the Mega Backdoor Roth option, so that’s off the table. Given that, I’m trying to decide whether to roll over my old 401(k) into a Fidelity IRA or transfer it to the new Empower 401(k).

Current Portfolio (All in Fidelity):

	•	Individual 401(k): $62,447.50 (VTI)
	•	Roth IRA: $23,859 (FFIJX)
	•	Old 401(k): $75,190.29 (FXAIX)
	•	HSA: $7,081 (FXAIX, FZROX)
	•	Total Portfolio: $168,579.36

Questions:

	1.	Since the Mega Backdoor Roth isn’t an option, would rolling over my old 401(k) to a Fidelity IRA be the best move, or should I transfer it to Empower’s 401(k)? I trust Fidelity more but want to ensure I’m making the right choice in terms of fees, fund options, and growth potential.
	2.	Portfolio Allocation: Given that I’m looking to aggressively save and potentially retire early, does my current allocation make sense? Should I be making any changes, or adjusting my exposure to certain funds (e.g., VTI, FXAIX, etc.)?

Any input on the best rollover option or feedback on my portfolio would be appreciated!",2024-09-30 17:26:49,1.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,DATEV eG,split accounts (vs joint accounts),"I'm in a long term relationship where we each maintain separate finances.

We've started discussing how to more conveniently pool finances for shared expenses (rent, utilities) without having to transfer money back/forth or otherwise ""true up"" or track expenses. However, we're not super interested in creating a joint account as that would pretty fundamentally alter how we manage our finances.

Instead, I've been looking for a solution to automatically split funding sources for payments. e.g., one of us would make a rent payment and the funding for that payment would be split across our two existing bank accounts.

I'm having a really tough time finding options in this space. I found Ivella's [Split Account product](https://www.ivella.com/split-account) which is exactly what I'm looking for, but apparently [it's shutting down](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ctdcoi/my_bank_shut_down_looking_for_a_new_one/). I also found [Cino](https://www.getcino.com) which does the same, but I can't find any reviews of this service and its website doesn't inspire an awful lot of confidence...

Does anyone know of any more reputable institutions that might offer products like this? Or any keywords I should be searching for when looking into this kind of product?",2024-05-20 13:13:51,1.0,8.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,DATEV eG,"Increase Roth 403B contributions, Traditional 403b, Backdoor Roth, Traditional IRA, or Ind Brokerage?","I have reviewed the prime directive, but I still can't always get my head around what is the best decision after getting my employee match as there must be nuances I am just not getting my head around no matter how much I read. Currently putting about 20% of my income (\~14% of household income), not including employer match, into all retirement accounts, and my wife is contributing to both a pension (9%) and SS.

I was using a financial planner and paying 1%, but recently fired them and am going to do this on my own. I currently put 10% into my Roth 403b at work, with a guaranteed 3% match and a possible additional up to 3%, but that has not happened in the 4 years I have been here. In addition to that, my wife and I  were previously contributing $1000 a month total to our advisor to be split between a Roth IRA and an individual brokerage account and plan to continue contributing that amount. 

My wife and I file taxes separately due to student loans, as we are both on PSLF and I make about twice as much as she does. Obviously that means for the next few years I would have to do a backdoor Roth. In thinking about the best way to distribute our retirement funds, would it make the most sense to start contributing to a traditional 403b as a way to decrease my tax burden and student loan payments? I believe I could do both accounts, or I could move all my work retirement into the traditional to decrease the tax burden even more but then would have no post tax contributions. 

Since this would ""cost"" less than $1000 net income for the same amount into retirement accounts (If my math is right, my net income would only decrease about $700/month), would it make sense to ALSO contribute that $300? And if so what would the benefits be of a traditional IRA/Backdoor Roth or just an individual brokerage account where I would do more individual stock rather than ETF's and market funds? Or since the contribution is the same just use that $300 to get to our other financial goals (e.g., home reno, new car savings, etc).

Reddit,DATEV eG,Tracking 401(k) and other benefits from old company,"I am an immigrant to the US and have been living here for almost 15 years. When I started working here, I signed up for some company benefits (voluntarily and involuntarily), but I didn't track all of them seriously because I wasn't sure about settling down here permanently. However, when this started becoming more of a reality in the last 5 years or so, I started tracking all my investments (401(k), Treasury bonds, stocks, etc.).

With regards to my older investments, what can I do to review/check if my money is laying around somewhere that I am now aware of? E.g.,

1. 401(k) investment from my older company - I am not sure if I opted for one in my first/second company
2. HSA - same as above
3. Company provided benefits (Pension funds, Stocks, etc.)

I wanted to check on reddit the efficient way to perform this due diligence. I could reach out to my old company HRs but the companies have been acquired; all team members have changed and so this route would be a nightmare of hours and hours of phone calls and emails. I could call all major investment holding companies (like fidelity, e-trade, etc.) and cross check with my SSN but I may not have the exhaustive list and might still lose some through the cracks.

Is there a centralized government tracker, where they are all linked to my SSN?

Also, I have all my W-2s and was full-time at every company. If information would be contained in that, I could check there. I wasn't sure if all company benefits were also captured there.

# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Check your percentages!**  There are two different challenges this month depending on your position in the [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) list of steps.

1. **If you're on steps 0 through 3, do the first challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Building an emergency fund
  - Paying down expensive debt (interest rate over 10%)

2. **If you're on steps 4 through 6, do the second challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Saving for retirement
  - Investing for other long-term goals

3. **If you're not sure which challenge applies best to you (e.g., not saving for retirement yet, but don't have credit card debt), feel free to pick and choose from either challenge.**

4. **Bonus points: do both challenges!**

# First challenge

Your challenge is to pursue improving your interest rates.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* If you have debts, compile information on each debt including the type of debt, the amount owed, and the interest rate. Also [find out your credit score and review your credit report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%2830-day+challenge+get+on+top+of+your+credit%29&sort=relevance&restrict_sr=on&t=year#res-hide-options)
* If you have credit card debt that you are carrying from month-to-month, [call up your credit card company and make a request to lower your interest rate](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-to-lower-credit-card-interest-rate/).
* If you have enough money in your checking account to cover *at least* one month of expenses, start building a second tier to your emergency fund by opening a savings account and deposit $50 or more into it.
* If you already have a savings account, [research your options](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/) and consider moving your savings account to a bank paying a higher rate.  (The wiki has some [common recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).)

# Second challenge

Your challenge is to audit your investment expenses and emergency fund.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Request a fee schedule/statement from your financial advisor (if you have one).
* Request a fee schedule/statement from the administrator of your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (or find out your fees by logging into your plan account).
* Look through recent statements to see if there are any charges you don't recognize.
* Calculate your [blended expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio).
* Evaluate your emergency fund and adjust it accordingly if your expenses and/or risk tolerance have changed. If you raised it, make a plan to meet your new e-fund goal sometime in the future.

The idea here is that you might uncover some expenses you didn't know you were paying, which in turn might give you a reason to make a change for the better. The impact of [costs on investments can be depressing](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost). If you find a clean slate, sleep well knowing that your money is working for you first and your investment company second. Another way to sleep well is to ensure you have enough set aside for emergencies. You may have set up your emergency fund goal and met it a number of years ago and perhaps times have changed for you. It's a great time to ensure you have an appropriate amount set aside for your expenses and risk tolerance.

Reddit,DATEV eG,Rolling returns for NSE India Indexes feedback,"Hi everyone,

I am trying to narrow down a investment catergory for my SIP. So I started calculating rolling returns based on daily NAV values downloaded from NSE website.

Following are my steps.

1. Cacluate 10/7/5 Year rolling returns at daily level.
2. Data is available from 2005 to 2024. NAV data considered is closing value of Index for that day.
3. Average all rolling returns by the returns period i.e. Avg 10Year RR = Avg of all 10 Year rolling returns

My confusion is the rolling return values seem too low given the CAGRs that are available in MF review site e.g. Zerodha Coin, MoneyControl etc.

Is my method for calculating Rolling Returns correct? All my calculations I am trying to find out a Index suitable to my risk. I am currently invested in Active Largecap MF. Planning to switch to 3 Index funds for variable goal timelines.

10Year RR Avg:

* NIFTY 100: 11.13%
* NIFTY 50: 10.70%
* NIFTY 500: 11.16%
* NIFTY LARGEMIDCAP 250: 12.56%
* NIFTY MIDCAP 150: 14.26%
* NIFTY MIDSMALLCAP: 400: 13.40%
* NIFTY NEXT 50: 13.64%
* NIFTY SMALLCAP 250: 11.66%

7Year RR Avg:

* NIFTY 100: 7.49%
* NIFTY 50: 7.25%
* NIFTY 500: 7.43%
* NIFTY LARGEMIDCAP: 2508.32%
* NIFTY MIDCAP 150: 9.31%
* NIFTY MIDSMALLCAP 400: 8.68%
* NIFTY NEXT 50: 8.91%
* NIFTY SMALLCAP 250: 7.41%

5Year RR Avg:

* NIFTY 100: 11.08%

Reddit,DATEV eG,I could use your advice on how to manage a raise request!,"Here's all the context I can think of (with **tl;dr at the bottom**):

I'm 31, live in a city with a population of \~50k on the East Coast, and have been working with a very small (<10 person) environmental project developer since December 2021, as my first real job after finishing a 2-year professional environmental master's degree in 2020. 

Given what I was seeing peers from my master's program make (median of $90-100k for those in the private sector), I asked for $70-80k a year as my starting salary, and was offered $60k to start with given the company's ""start-up"" budget (using quotes since we're not in tech, just the voluntary carbon market). There was the expectation that raises and bonuses would come along if business went well.

I negotiated to get health insurance since that was a deal-breaker for me, and am getting my full health insurance premium (\~$390/mo.) covered by the company. In January 2023, I got a 10% raise (so I've been at $66k this year). Mid-year performance review this year went very well, and I brought up to my bosses (the co-founders of the company) that I wanted to ask for a raise given that December 2023 would mark two years and still technically not being at my original target salary range. I have about $100k in federal student loans since I didn't have any savings before grad school to pay for living expenses, let alone tuition, which is why despite liking my bosses and the work well enough, I feel like I can't afford to be earning below a certain threshold given how expensive my education was.

My bosses told me during both the mid-year and end-of-year performance review that the budget was still a bit tight (e.g. they still aren't taking salaries themselves), so the 10% annual raise that they're hoping to give each of us employees in the first few years is the most they can do for now, other than bringing a 401k 5% match online in Jan' 24. This would put me at $72.6k next year, plus the new 401k and match. While I'm not privy to all our financials, I do believe that there are genuine budget limitations, but probably not at the level where another $10k/year (to throw out a round number) would throw us into the red. They've also expressed that they want me to be happy/feel valued and stay with the company, so I don't know if that's a soft invitation to keep negotiating, within reason.

Basically, they are wondering if my grad school's numbers are skewed by ""big city"" graduates in high cost-of-living areas, and asked me if I could find figures for young professionals in our city to give us a better range to look at for reference. I've recently found two local job postings from The Nature Conservancy that don't require a master's degree and I qualify for on paper that are each offering $55-60k, and remote environmental NGO positions that my former classmates landed paying $62k, $70k, and $75k in the last year or two. I think that's pretty good fodder for the argument that a private for-profit salary should be higher, even if it's with a young, under-funded company. I don't enjoy having to compare myself to others, especially when it comes to money, but also feel this pressure with my looming loans to not sell myself short and accept less.

**TL;DR:** I'm getting a 10% raise and a 5% 401k match for 2024, which I'm grateful for, but my starting salary was at least $10k/year less than what I feel I deserve(d) so I also want to ask for more. I just can't figure out what that number should be, or if I should be patient for another six months and see if finances come and change our company's situation!

Reddit,DATEV eG,"Am I better paying my whole pay check onto credit card and then paying for new spending with CC, to reduce interest on old purchases?","Hi all,

TL:DR is the title. 

This is making sense to me but I want to sense check with others.

I have 3 credit cards I am able to pay down fairly quickly with my paycheck each week. ($600per week onto CCs) which is what I can afford.

But even though my balances are reducing (focusing on higher interest CC first), I’m now getting higher interest charged each month as we are hitting the corresponding time period when I did most of the CC spending. 

Q - even though I can only afford to put $600 on my CCs each week, am I better off putting say $900 on my CCs each week and using the CCs for new spending - eg food and other expenses, so I can reduce the interest on the old purchases?

Generally, this is how it works right?

Yes and I will also review the terms and conditions of each card to confirm :)

Reddit,DATEV eG,Should I stay with my financial advisor?,"Over the past month, I reviewed the family finances while transitioning away from Mint to Monarch Money. One of the stops along that journey was Empower, because of which one of their sales people to called to pitch their services in an attempt to convince me that they would do better than my current Financial Advisor (FA) because of <yadda yadda yadda>. The real consequence of that conversation was to spur me to determine whether or not another approach would actually be better than my current situation. So I've learned about things like 3-fund portfolios and low-cost robo-traders like Vanguard Digital Advisor from places like YouTube, Bogleheads, and here. The general sentiment from all of the posts I’ve read suggests that the fee my FA charges (\~1% AUM) is likely significantly eating into what my actual returns would be if I just self managed using low-cost index funds using something like a strategy based around a 3-fund portfolio. With this knowledge I sought to understand whether or not this could be true, given the 10+ year history of my FA-managed investments as compared to a prospective 3-fund portfolio consisting of VTSAX, VTIAX and VBTLX.

Comparing their 1, 3, 5, 10 year performance, (FA vs 3-fund) i see the following:

If the 3-fund was moderately balanced @ VTSAX (64%), VTIAX (16%) and VBTLX (20%).

* 1 year: FA does better by 6.45%
* 3 year: FA does better by 1.69%
* 5 year: FA does better by 0.62%
* 10 year: FA does worse by 0.03%

If the 3-fund was aggressively balanced @ VTSAX (70%), VTIAX (20%) and VBTLX (10%).

* 1 year: FA does better by 4.84%
* 3 year: FA does better by 0.78%
* 5 year: FA does worse by 0.47%
* 10 year: FA does worse by 0.70%

It is stated on the FA brokerage’s website that their rate of return is considerate of their \~1% fee. Overall, it looks like they’ve generally done better than the market over the past 3 years. For 5 years and beyond, they've exceeded or matched the “moderate” profile while underperforming the aggressive profile.

My partner and I have had the FA for over 10 years. In addition to the various investment accounts they directly manage (Roth, IRA, Taxable, 529) they also provide guidance on our 401k & HSA investment selections, fully handle the backdoor Roth process on our behalf, and have provided other advice to regarding topics such as life insurance, college savings, possible real estate purchases, and tax filing advice. Admittedly, I made the choice to get a FA in my thirties because I knew that I was neither attentive or qualified to make the smart choices about my long-term financial security.  That sentiment may still be true today for myself and my partner, despite my momentarily increased interest. It is for this reason that their handling of the backdoor Roth contributions is useful to me, given that no low-cost hybrid advisor (e.g. Vanguard Personal Advisor) would do the backdoor Roth for me.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that there has never been a ""bad"" moment throughout the business relationship with my FA. The only actual disappointment has been \~5 years of missed opportunity for backdoor Roth contributions.

So.. what do you think that I should do?",2024-01-22 02:49:20,1.0,3.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,DATEV eG,What’s the best place to buy cash gift cards?,"I was asked to purchase cash gift cards as Christmas gifts for some administrative staff for our team.

Reddit,Sorted,What happens to me (taxpayer) when I report my tax preparer for fraud on my 2023 taxes?,"First off, I feel so stupid and taken advantage of. 2023 was the first year I had a good paying job for myself, $34k, and was suggested a tax preparer by my sibling who uses one of their friends family members. So it was a referral of someone I don’t personally know, but trusted because my sibling has used them a few years.

I didn’t know what to expect, I usually would get $200-300 on my returns but I was making significantly less. I didn’t ask the right questions, barely any, it was all through a phone call and took maybe 15 minutes sending the documents to this lady. Signed the e-file, I don’t remember reviewing it. Eventually I got the refund back and it was around $2.3k. Paid the tax preparer $225 and never thought about it again. 

Well, the conversation at work came up about taxes and all of my colleagues (who make the same amount as me) were discussing their refunds. Mine being the only one that stood out. Now I go on the IRS website to see the PDF’s of my history and I notice her name isn’t on my forms, her identification number isn’t on my forms, and a claim of $59,000 for medical and dental expenses I *never* had done.

I am overwhelmed with finding this out that I began to panic. I know I signed something, but I didn’t sign for that, and I didn’t know she would have 0 tie to my return at all. I’m furious and all I have is her phone number, name, and last name. 

I found a form online (14157) I filled out all the way and I’m ready to send it and report her to the IRS, I am willing to send all the money back, because I received it undeserved. But I am scared the IRS will come after me, for jail time or something along the lines of being a criminal. This is why I feel so stupid, I was just expecting a higher return because I made double my income this year for the first time. I never expected to be in this situation.

Reddit,Sorted,Excess Roth Contribution Math and Next Steps,"Hi All!

I realized this afternoon that I have been making some ineligible contributions to Roth IRAs over the past few years (have not received any sort of notification from IRS though) and am looking for some help in reviewing the math and next steps to correct those those excess contributions. Would greatly appreciate any help in reviewing this!

**Contributions by Tax Year**

2021-$3,000

2022-$3,000

2023-$3,000

2024-$1,500



From what I can gather, these are the next steps to satisfy these erroneous contributions with the IRS:

* Amend 2021 Tax return and pay penalty of 6% on $3,000 ($180) via Form 5329

* Amend 2022 Tax return and pay penalty of 6% on $6,000 ($360) via Form 5329

* Recharacterize 2023 and 2024 contributions as Traditional IRA ($4,500) via IRA custodian

* Withdraw 2021 and 2022 contributions ($6,000) and contribute to traditional IRA via IRA custodian

* Amend/File extended 2023 return and pay penalty of ($X) via Form 5329, AND report qualified distribution 
of $6,000 at line 20 of form 5329 to fully resolve the excess contributions

* Leave earnings from 2021 and 2022 in Roth IRA account and contribute to Traditional IRA moving forward

**Additional Questions**

 * For X: For 2023, am I paying the penalty on the 2021, 2022, and 2023 contributions? Or am I able to recharacterize the 2023 contributions now and only pay the penalty on the existing 2021 and 2022 contributions?

 * Is filing an amended return for 2023 within the 6 months extensions are available post-April 15, automatically covered or do I need to take additional steps to file for an extension?

Reddit,Sorted,Help with understanding additional medicare tax,"Hello I filed my taxes quite a while ago and was requested more information specifically a copy of my w2. The discrepancy is the computer is calculating my total payments differently than I submitted and therefore spitting back that the refund should be lower

The amount difference is matching exactly what I put in line 25c. I filled out and attached a 8959 and put in line 25c on my 1040 the amount in line 24 of the 8959. 

The data in my transcript shows that the 8959 I submitted and what the computer came up with is correct.

My question is, is the 25c the wrong place to put the 8959 additional Medicare tax withheld amount? Following the irs instructions this seems like the correct place. I spoke with the irs and they didn’t know what to tell me other than the refund amount was adjusted because of this discrepancy.

Reddit,Sorted,Why does Box 2 not match up with what I actually paid?,"I am filing my own taxes this year and my federal income tax withheld (box 2) states I only paid $784 but when I add up how much tax has been taken out of each individual pay stub, my math shows I've laid well over $3000..

Now I am by no means any sort of expert and I probably just don't understand what I am looking at.. so could anybody please explain why my fed. Tax withholdings are so vastly different on my W2s?

UPDATE:
 I reviewed each paystub for the past 2 years and noticed that I randomly stopped paying federal taxes partway through the year.

I receive bonuses and those get taxed. My paycheck also gets taxed during those bonus periods and only during those bonus periods. The bonus is always separate and taxed separately as well.

I was making salary so I didn't review every check... 

Also.. even though I stopped paying federal taxes, my take home pay remained the same.

I got switched to hourly this year after a renegotiation and have since been paying federal taxes... though no new w4 was completed during any of this time. I only did the original w4 which was claimed as 1.


I am a bit sketched out by this... and  the fact that our general manager was once convicted of fraud in the last doesn't make me feel any more at ease.",2024-02-03 23:20:33,0.0,6.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Roth IRA overcontribution,"Hello folks,

Doing our taxes on FreeTaxUSA, and got to the end where they provide a review of your return. It states that my wife and I overcontributed to our Roth IRA during the year because our MAGI is in-between the max contribution amount for 2023 (married filing jointly, $218k-228k). We were at \~$227k, so right on the line, and the tax software said that we were only allowed to contribute $300 each.

My question is: how do I go about withdrawing the excess contributions and backdooring them back into the Roth? At the moment, they are already invested in funds; do I sell the amount needed to prevent the penalty, transfer to my bank account, transfer back to a regular IRA, then recharacterize from there (for the 2023 tax year)? This would be my first time doing a backdoor... so not as familiar with the process.

Or would it be easier to call our brokerage (Fidelity) to sort this out?

If I've already submitted our taxes, and we fix the overcontribution, do I need to file an amended return to specify that we withdrew the excess contribution?

Reddit,Sorted,Treatment of business expenses likely to be revised,"This is more of a practical question. Every year I review my accounts held by a property manager who is not the fastest at getting statements out. Inevitably in a pile of hundreds of transactions I find a few suspected mistakes adding up to a few thousand dollars or so - double billings, missing refunds, sometimes a legit question on whether work was actually done or an approved payment actually made, that sort of thing. These are actual charges paid in a cash basis partnership but there's likely to be an adjustment after filing deadlines and that adjustment may be a credit against upcoming work. How do people normally handle this sort of churn? I know I could just file extensions and wait for a final answer but that holds up K-1s and personal returns for partners who get testy about that. The same happens if I issue surprise revised K-1s later and people have to amend returns. Is it acceptable to apply corrections to the next fiscal year when they're finally determined?

Reddit,Sorted,How to handle a CPA messing up my taxes (NJ & PA),"Hi everyone,

Not sure if this is the right sub to be posting this but wanted to start here. I’m having some issues sorting out how to resolve a Delinquent Earned Income Tax Notice for 2020 and 2021, and more specifically the CPA I worked with. I’ll try to give as much detail below but can provide more info if asked:


I’ve been working with the same CPA for the last several years because my wife and I worked and lived in a few different states and wanted the peace of mind that taxes were being filed correctly. 

A few months back I received a letter from Keystone Collections, attempting to collect unpaid tax for 2020 for the township of my residence in PA. I reached out to my CPA and he told me I should send them a copy of my PA and NJ state returns, as well as the Local return and that should clear things up. His belief was that everything was done correctly when we filed. I sent everything over and waited.

I heard back a couple weeks ago and Keystone advised that they reviewed my case and found that I’m still liable for the tax bill. Shortly after they sent another notice for 2021. I just got off the phone with my CPA this morning and he tells me something to the effect of:

“I looked at everything again and it seems like you do actually owe the local taxes for those years.”

He told me there was nothing they could do, and that he believes Keystone is correct. I asked if the office had any sort of remediation they could extend to me for their mistake, or if we could file an E&O claim through their insurance. He said he wasn’t sure. Now, the issue isn’t the amount, we’re talking less than $1,000 for both years, but I am very pissed I paid this office hundreds of dollars each tax season to handle this SPECIFICALLY so I wouldn’t be in this situation. I’ve had him review our paystubs to determine if withholdings were correct any time we started a new job or moved. I did about everything I thought I could do to be proactive. 

My question is this: in the event of an error, am I justified in seeking compensation from the CPA, and if so, how much? Do they cover the tax bill? Do they refund me what I paid for services? I don’t know what standard practice is and I’m not looking to get one over on anyone, but I want to be made whole for this mistake.",2023-12-08 15:31:27,1.0,3.0,tax,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,"Employer changed payroll companies and caused an IRS mess at the federal level.  It got sorted, but I've lost the forms and need them now for a state review.  ","tl;dr - IRS found some issues, sent me a sheet that said ""this is what you filed versus this is what was sent to us - please pay the difference that we've calculated"".  I paid, lost the sheet, and now the *state* is asking if I owe them anything and I can't figure out how to proceed.  

The longer version: in 2021, we switched payroll providers mid-year, and in addition to the proper W2 being sent to the IRS, the half-year one from the first company also got sent.  So in 2023, I got a letter from the IRS saying ""hey, what's with this unreported W2 from '21?""

I was able to fix it, but in the process of this whole thing, the IRS saw that I had forgotten to submit a form from a small brokerage account that I'd completely forgotten about - so they sent me a sheet with a breakdown of what I filed versus what they discovered, and I paid it off based on that.  Got a receipt that I was all set.

Except now, over a year later, my state audit department has sent me a letter saying ""hey, the IRS sent us an amended return - if you owe us anything, please file.  If you don't, disregard"".  I have a feeling I do owe *something*, but here's the problem: I cannot, for the life of me, find the documents that the IRS sent last year.  And now, I can't even figure out what the form would have been called that the IRS sent me, so I can't even attempt to look it up, let alone request a new copy.  I'm completely lost as to how to proceed.

Reddit,Sorted,How can I be sure my mother isn't falling prey to a financial scam?,"My mother has had an account worth nearly a million dollars at an investment firm for about five years. Over the years I've been on conference calls with her and her financial advisor (recommended to us by her sister, who has been with him for nearly twenty years) and until recently I thought her money was safely growing there.

Three days ago, she texted me to tell me that she was firing him because ""we can do better elsewhere."" She is absolutely furious with him and the account's rate of return. I don't have access to the account and so I can't speak to how badly the account has been underperforming, but I was taken aback by how uncharacteristically angry my mother was and still is with him and his firm and I'm afraid intense emotions may be clouding her judgment.

So when she told me she'd already decided what she wants to do with her money, I was immediately suspicious. From what I've been able to piece together, about three weeks ago she reached out to a small, independent financial company a 5 hours' drive away from her home in a neighboring state and is totally convinced that this avenue is the best way forward for her money. She sent me a link to the website - I was deeply unimpressed, and the site looks to be more style than substance, but I thought in spite of everything there was a chance it could be an honest enterprise.

I find it a little concerning, though, that the proprietor of that business drove with his family all the way to my mother's town yesterday and attended church with her today before calling me to discuss his business with the three of us. Isn't it nice they decided to devote a whole weekend to this one potential client? Maybe he really is just that wholesome and magnanimous, but I have to assume for my mother's safety that he's either going the extra mile just to lock down a substantial commission with a sizeable account, OR he's a shameless con man about to fleece her.

My mother is bent on getting her funds away from our current broker as quickly as possible - maybe for good reason, but I don't believe in making hasty and emotional decisions with this amount of money, and I would prefer to explore several options before making any decisions. Right now, though, my main concern is making sure that this man is at least legitimate. From what they tell me, the plan is simply to open an annuity account at Nationwide - this independent guy isn't directly affiliated with Nationwide, but collects some sort of referral fee. And he stressed repeatedly that neither he nor his company is ever in direct contact with her funds.

However, there were two things that worried me in our conversation today. The first is that, when I questioned why there was such an urgent need to move the account as soon as possible, he suggested that ""anything could happen"" if my mother keeps her money where it's at. He claims he hasn't been badmouthing our current financial advisor, but implying that our current firm could do irreversible damage in the next few weeks if we don't sign IMMEDIATELY is absolutely ridiculous. And the biggest red flag for me was that, when I said that we ought to have our lawyer double check whatever documents he's going to present my mother, he called that a ""waste of money."" Exact words!

I called my mother later, in private, and she did agree to run things by our lawyer first, for whatever that's worth. I'm no expert, but my gut tells me something doesn't feel right here. I plan to call Nationwide first thing in the morning and find out if they've had dealings with this man or his company before. **What other due diligence should I be doing right now?**

EDIT: **Is BBB accreditation worth anything?** I found the company on the BBB website. According to their records, they have been in business for one year and accredited with the BBB for almost three months with an A- rating, but there isn't a lot of information about it otherwise. They also have about a dozen positive reviews on Google, most of which are a year or more old but also few from the past few months and weeks. If it was a restaurant I would think twice about eating there, but I'm not the one making the decisions here, unfortunately

EDIT #2: Calling Nationwide directly didn't do me any good - all they can tell me, apparently, is that most people who use their services come to them directly. I called the insurance department for his state. According to them, he is licensed, but they couldn't find a license for his LLC. I called him to request the licensing number for his LLC, and he told me that his LLC is not licensed because, since he himself is licensed, there is no need. He claimed he was an ""open book"" and that I could ask him anything about his ""personal history, military history, and belief in God."" I then asked him if he was a fiduciary. He claimed to be, but would not tell me his CRD number and I cannot find any record of him at the national database: [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)  He became irritated and told me he was only going to communicate with my mother going forward.",2024-09-23 04:24:52,43.0,68.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Family situation coming to a head,"Grandmother is 96 and living alone (!) with no real plan sorted out for her future care by the remaining siblings, my mother and uncle.  At long last my uncle and his wife have decided to sell their house and move in with her.    
  
He has set a meeting with a lawyer later this month in my grandmother’s town and told my mother to be there to “get some documents signed”, documents that have NOT been provided to her for review in advance of this meeting that he arranged.    
  
House is currently in a living trust with assets split 3 ways – mother, uncle and the son and daughter of their brother who passed several years ago.  He has stated that he needs to have the house put into his name in order to move in.  Meanwhile he is urgently trying to sell his own home and putting pounds of pressure on my already overly stressed mother to sign off on documents that she is supposed to view and sign on arrival to the meeting.  He does NOT want his brother’s daughter and son present at the meeting for what seems like obvious reasons.  The fact that they have let things go so far down the road to where my grandmother is damn near 100 years old and still living alone is alarming in itself, but the immediate urgency of the whole situation seems extremely suspect.  It seems like he is leveraging a difficult situation to force my mother to sign off on her stake.  
  
For the moment I’ve told my mother to work on two things.  Finding the existing document copies in regards to my grandmother’s estate.  And requesting copies of the revised documents from my uncle in a text that he is expecting her to sign.    
  
Talking to her the first day after she was made aware of the meeting, she was all ears.  The next day it seems like she is ready to roll over and fold.  Complicated by having next to no understanding of how terms are currently outlined or if she even has a copy to review.

Reddit,Sorted,Program or app recommendation for identifying and canceling subscriptions.,"I admittedly have thought about this for a few months after being targeted by adds from a company many of you are probably familiar with (RM).

Between my girlfriend and I think our monthly subscription costs have probably got out of hand for things like streaming services etc. Im sure we even have 1 or 2 subscriptions that both of us are paying for at this point even though we have been living together for quite some time.

Long story short I'm looking for an easy way to identify all the subscriptions I am paying for so we can inventory them and decide what to keep, what to get rid of, and where there may be some redundancies.  

I'm looking for any insights on what the best way to go about doing this is. An app or something that streamlines the process would be ideal if there is a good one out there. I did a bit of research on peoples experience with RM and it seems that they have mixed reviews. 

I don't mind paying a resonable fee if there is a program or app out there that will make this process easier than going through all my bank statements, although I recognize that *may* be the best course of action. I'm just looking for options.  

My plan over the next month or so is to create an actual budget, which is long overdue, and be better about keeping track of things like monthly subscriptions etc so I don't end up in the same place again. 

Thanks in advance for any advice. If there is a good guide written up for these sorts of things I would be happy to give that a read if someone could point me in the right direction. I used the search function, but didn't find much.",2024-11-27 01:00:42,0.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Prudential Long Term Care Bond,"Hello,  
  
I’m keen to hear if anyone has experience with, or knowledge about, Prudential's Long Term Care Bond. This product was originally purchased by my grandparents in 1997 under its former name, the Scottish Amicable Long Term Care Bond.

In 2020 we completed the sale of my grandparents’ home after my grandfather passed away and my grandmother moved into a care home. It seems that both of them held policies, but the capital amount was significantly lower than the £20,000 each had invested in 1997.

Given the product’s name, I had assumed it was designed to help cover care home fees if one spouse entered care after the other passed away. This is precisely the situation we are now facing. However, we haven’t had any communication from Prudential in the past four years. We also haven’t received any statements, details of key benefits, or other relevant updates regarding the product.  


The original documentation we have indicates some sort of £20,000 per annum payout, but it does not clarify under what circumstances or when this would be claimable.

There are a few articles online, whereby people had issues in receiving the investment value: See Guardian Article, from 2007 titled: Long-term care bond victory.

It would appear that 'Pru Intl review shuts LTC bond' in 2003.

If anyone has insights or additional information about this bond, I would greatly appreciate your input.

Reddit,Sorted,How do I know if a debt collector is legit?,"Hello everyone!

I recently made a post about receiving an email saying I owed debt. I called the hospital to see if it was true, and they confirmed it. They told me they sent it to a debt collector, and I'd have to talk with them. There's a bit more to it, but that's the basic gist. My new issue is that I'm not sure if I should even trust these guys at all. I've never been in debt before, so I don't know how to handle debt collectors and things of that nature. I googled the company and found that there were a lot of reviews about them, essentially saying that they're scammers.

 I had called them because the hospital told me to get information. The lady on the phone was nice; however, she didn't know much about how much I owed and said that my account was merged with my father's, so they couldn't tell me how much I exactly owed until they could set up my own account. I was with my father whenever I was doing this call because he had claimed that my mother was resolving her debt through them as well. I thought everything was okay, and my dad was assuring me that it was, so they asked for some of my personal information, like my social security number, address, and things of that nature, so they could set up my own account and basically separate my bills from my father's bills. Before this, I had made sure to confirm through EOB statements and my own bank statements that the visits were real and that I hadn't paid them, at least from what my bank statement stated. So I gave them my information; they kept asking me if I accepted all of the debt, and I told them that I wanted to receive, like, a letter of some sort of just everything that was on my account that they were claiming was mine to make sure that they weren't putting anything that was my dad's on my account and all of that, and once I looked at that, then I would tell them whether I accepted it or not, because I just wanted to double-check. 

They told me that that was fine, that they were closing soon, and that they would call me back the following week (II called on a Friday afternoon, and they said they'd call me on Monday). I waited for a call. I received none, and now I'm on week two of basically just waiting for them to call me back. I don't know if I should trust them still; as I stated in my previous post, I wasn't aware of these medical charges at all. I wasn't given any letters, emails, or calls from the hospital at all that these charges were on my account. 

My husband and I are doing rather well right now. I just graduated from college, and I'm getting some certification so that I can get a job, so I really don't want to mess up my future when it's barely starting. I trusted my father, but it seems that every time I trust him, it doesn't go very well, and the claim that my mother was resolving her debt through them isn't very comforting either. She's been a victim of a lot of scams as well that I had to help her get out of and just help her resolve in general. I feel rather stupid that I gave them my information, and I've been keeping an eye on my credit score to see if there's been any marks on that, and I'm just really worried. We don't make a lot of money, so I don't know if I can even afford an attorney if the debt collectors decide to go that route, and I live in a small town, so I don't even know if there's any attorneys that cover this kind of stuff around here. 

I'm sorry for my rambling again; I just don't want to go into the same lifestyle that my parents created for themselves when I was little. I saw how that went, and I see how they are now, and I don't want to be like that. I can give the collection agency's name if you guys need, and I'll try to provide as much information in the comments as I can. I'm going to be calling them back today to see what's going on. I appreciate any of the advice and help that I get from here. I don't really have many reliable people in my life to get advice from, and the people at the hospital and the debt collection agencies just kind of treat me like I'm an absolute idiot for asking any questions about how this happened or how it came about.  ",2024-10-28 14:10:11,0.0,3.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Is Bankruptcy the way to go at 27?,"Hi, 27 here - father of 2 - new to this subreddit and reddit in general, but so glad I found it! (The questions and topics here are truly helpful, as well as the answers - so I figured I'd try my own)

I'm a father of 2, looking to create some kind of upward mobility for my family hopefully by 30, but can be realistic to be by 35. At least seeing some kind of improvement / growth by 30.

I was within the Marketing sector, but recently got let go due to differences in creativity, strategy, etc. etc.

The meat and potatoes:

27 year old here with no savings, no income, and horrible credit.

Currently 61k in debt (47k from loans) (14k in collections) one paid-off credit card from a jewelry store in 2020 and a score of 544 from Credit Karma (so we know it's significantly lower on an actual report.)

I currently have thought of going through bankruptcy, but have heard so many mixed reviews about it.

Long term goals; I'd like to purchase a home by time my kids are at least 8/9 (they're currently 3 & 5) and I'm also a car guy, so I'd like to be in some sort of position to acquire some of the cars me and my 5yo watch on YouTube or go crazy at dealerships over. In short, I'd like to be in an extremely better position than now within the next 4-5 years.

I'm a ""self taught"" marketer, that happened to have a great ""6 months"" about 2 years ago when I made about 30k on the side. But it completely took me away from my family, and had me mentally exhausted - but money flowed. I jumped out as fast as I jumped in and applied those marketing skills to work for a formal company with salary and set hours, etc. for a bit of balance - but continuous back and forth with management killed it all.

Question is: Would bankruptcy be the way to go? 61k in debt with no real income is scary. And some of the things are like evictions, or unpaid furniture loans. Or should I work my a#$ off and get another job in corporate space or even bartending, etc that can do well in tips and kind of help me stay afloat / pay off bills? Or should I change gears in all and pick up skills within another sector?

Sorry, I know this is a tough-y but I'd truly like to hear some opinions / suggestions! Or decisions you'd make if you were in my position.",2024-07-07 23:04:32,0.0,11.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,

• YNAB seems to have an almost cult like following and seems to be extremely popular with people who are eager to save. The features also seem quite accessible and clear. I really liked that you can do the equivalent of cash stuffing and also move it around incase you overspent in one category and underspent in another. I also really liked that they have the provision to link your bank account and reconcile every few days to make sure the balance is correct on both the app and your bank account. ""Heard It From Hannah"" is also such a fun, accessible, almost addictive series! There's a one year free student account so that's a bonus (and ample time to test it out before buying a plan). 

• PLUM, although also popular, doesn't have the same cult like following. There are comparatively fewer reviews on YT. Again, I really liked that they have the provision to link your bank account but I am a little unsure about the safety aspect since PLUM moves money from your bank account to the PLUM app account. I like that it's AI (and has many savings funds like rainy fund) because it makes it convenient, and even fun to save. I understand that the investing feature is quite popular but I think it'll be a while before I start investing/ using that feature. Finally, the free version seems adequate for beginners. 

About me: 
I'm an incoming international student and will be dependent on my standard UKRI stipend. I do not have any other income streams. I also have a fair amount of financial anxiety (I'm working on it with a therapist). 

For the moment, my financial goals include: 1) creating an emergency fund 2) After the emergency fund is sorted, saving atleast 30% of stipend each month for future needs. 

What do you think will be better for me? YNAB or PLUM?",2024-08-19 14:59:02,1.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Budgeting for student loan payments and having no savings.,"I will be honest here, I am in 46, graduated college in 2006, and have been on an income driven repayment plan since then. But I have always been broke. Even now I only earn $16 an hour and work on average 36-37 hours a week (certified pharmacy tech at an independent pharmacy). I live in a small rural town without many options. 

I am not sure why, but I thought that after 20-25 years on any repayment plan my student loans would just be forgiven. Like a 'well, you tried your best' sort of thing. I have no idea why I thought that was true. For the past 18 years I have not made enough money to need to make payments (according to their determination). I also haven't been saving anything. I have about $3300 total in savings right now. So retirement is something that may never happen. I don't have a 401k but a small IRA from a previous job that has $1800 that I can't add to. I will say, I also don't have any other debt. Paid for house and paid for car. $0 balance on my credit card. 800 credit score.

My husband doesn't have student loans, but also doesn't have savings, has also always been broke. He recently got a decent job and brings home about $1000 a month more than I do and he covers health insurance. Other than that, we have separate finances. But we file joint taxes.

My monthly 'bills' are $960. That is my portion of house bills. It includes all utilities, cell phone, car insurance, food. Everything. That leaves me about $900 a month left over to use. Like I said, I haven't been saving. I have joked that I am allergic to money and must get it away from me, so I spend it as quickly as I get it. Not so funny anymore.

I got a notice from my student loan servicer today saying that after reviewing our taxes my payments are going to be $406 a month. I know I owe this money, that is fine. I am just angry at myself that I haven't been paying at least a little on them for the past 18 years. I did pay off a few of the smaller ones a couple months ago. Total remaining balance is $30,559.98 with an interest rate of 7.7%.

So I guess my question is: Do I just make that minimum payment every month? Do I try to pay more? Do I try to save a little as well? If I pay more and don't save anything I fear if there is an emergency I will have nothing to help, like if my car needs repairs. This is my debt before my husband so I don't want to ask him for help paying it off. 

Any advice, suggestions, admonishments to my monumental stupidity? I feel so screwed this late in life. But it is my fault. I just don't know what to do. 

Thank you in advance for your wisdom.",2024-07-04 23:43:31,1.0,8.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,What do do for insurance when previous insurer drops you while roof claim is open?,"I own a rental duplex that we used to house-hack, but since moved out of, and we've had insurance, (the duplex, auto, and homeowners) through one of the large company, call them X, for the past decade.  We've always paid on time, I get along well with my local agent, and we've generally felt pretty well cared for, though perhaps that was simply because we'd never submitted an at-fault or act-of-god claim before.

Earlier this year, there was a bad hail storm in our area, and A reached out to us to tell us that we should get our roof checked.  We did, and it our roof was modestly damaged.  This was also around the time that our policy was coming up for renewal with X, and A told us that (1) we'd need to get the roof fixed to stay compliant with the terms of our insurance, but (2) that this is totally covered by our policy, so it would all be covered, less our deductible, so we should find a contractor and put them in contact.  So we found a contractor, filed the roof claim, put them in contact with the claims folks at X, and they started negotiating.  X said the damage was light enough that simple repair is warranted.  The contractor claims the damage is more extensive and warrants a replacement is necessary.  I've been told by both sides that that is normal, and they'll negotiate for a couple months and then settle on something.  Either way I'm out my deductible but get my roof fixed.  I sit back and wait.  Then a couple weeks ago, I get a letter in the mail from X saying that they've declined to renew our policy for reasons unrelated to the roof (that they never articulated earlier over the past 7 years of insuring the duplex), so our coverage will lapse near the end of August.

My local agent was surprised by this, apologized profusely, and vowed to appeal that decision by the underwriting team.  In the meantime I started looking for someone else to insure with on the assumption that X doesn't change their mind.  It's now been a couple weeks and I've been talking to increasingly expensive and sketchy-sounding companies in the insurance market trying to get coverage for the duplex, only to inevitably be told they won't touch insuring the building while there's an open claim on the roof/a damaged roof.  Meanwhile X is saying that their review of the coverage appeal won't happen until days after our coverage will  lapse.

So to recap: Insurance company notices weather roof damage, tells us to file claim.  We do.  Claims process is dragging on.  During that time, X says they will not renew policy on building.  Noone else seems willing to touch the building while it has a damaged roof/open claim on it.  So, we're about to lose our insurance on the rental unit, and the mortgage company is breathing down my neck because our mortgage obviously requires us to keep it insured, and I'm starting to panic.

Reddit,Sorted,Bank's failure to monitor fraud. Now my poor elderly mother is on the hook,"Hi all, I'm wondering if anyone has come across such an issue before or can recommend anything. I am so sorry in advance for the long post and thank anyone who skims through it. Trust me, there are a lot more frustrating details but I tried to consolidate to the main points below.  
My mom (a senior citizen living in Brooklyn, NY on a fixed income) opened up a Santander credit card account this past summer. She is not tech savvy so she did not have any mobile app on her phone but when she received her second month's statement, she immediately called customer service to alert them that there was about 6K of fraud charges on her card. Since August 2023, we have been passed around by different internal teams (all extremely incompetent) and ultimately, the bank failed to conduct a proper investigation and closed 'their investigation' saying she owes the money, since they only issued one card and the card is was in her possession the entire time (HUGE RED FLAG that a bank allegedly does not know that there are a bunch of fake readers and people's info can get compromised.) My mom even asked them, ""im confused are you suggesting I lie to you and say it was stolen? I will not. I am an honest person - it was with my the entire time but somehow someone got my information."" Since she had it in her possession, they basically did nothing and told her she needs to pay up. Here are some more details:

1. These charges were done across 5 different states in a matter of days. My mom does not drive or own a car. One the customer service reps literally told her that one of the charges in Connecticut was done like 5 minutes after my mom's valid charge in Brooklyn .... like there are legit charges minutes apart where it is humanly impossible to be in 2 places in that sort of a time frame.
2. My mom stated on the phone multiple times that she has proof of that she was not there for any of these charges. She even happened to go to Citibank one of the days to open a CD so it's all on file and we offered up this information, yet they somehow chose to overlook this.
3. When someone reports fraud as I understand, the bank will try to do a chargeback and contact the issuer (mastercard.) My best friend works at MasterCard and has verified they did NOT even attempt to get this money back or open an investigation with MasterCard/ all the vendors (now the time has expired for Santander to do so) but they lied to us and told us they did reach out to MC until I called their bluff and they admit they didn't do anything...
4. We sent the executive office an affidavit stating she was not present for all the charges and explained her information was compromised somewhere. We got an absolute useless human being as our 'advocate' from the Executive Office who did nothing other than said he reviewed everything and discarded anything we said.
5. In speaking to my best friend (who works at MasterCard) it's COMMON KNOWLEDGE that frauders when they get people's CC info, they will first run the card through a vending machine, because it's low stakes if it gets declined. I literally educated to the idiot in 4) \[im sorry im not usually a name caller but my lord how do these people have jobs and are 'advocates'...\] and all his customer service buddies that it's 2024 and these hackers/frauders do this, including having ability to even mimic chips in cards. This is exactly how the fraud began on my mom's card!! So the fact that a bank isn't weighing this information and we have no protection as consumers is terrifying. My mom and I have both asked maybe 10+ times since this happened to get a detailed print out of the charges and times and locations. (because again, it's black and white it was not her) 7 months later, the 'advocate' tells me he will send it and when i start pressing him to find out the ETA, he tells me he needs to clear with the legal team if they can send this information. Still never received any details to this date. Sooo my mom is expected to pay someone else's shopping spree YET she can't know the time of charges? I mean from the beginning Santander has failed to stay-up-to-date on fraud, even make an ATTEMPT to verify what their consumers are saying, given false deadlines, conflicting information, and to date cannot give me any reason why they closed this case other than 'inconsistencies.' WHICH MAKES NO SENSE AND THEY REFUSE TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS BC THERE ARE NONE. It makes me feel like they messed up and are trying to hide it and hope it doesn't bite them in the ass. So far, we filed a case with BBB, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and contacted Experian to make sure no one opens a line of credit under her name but I do not know how to make Santander re-open this case or get someone competent from Santander to help .... We've even contacted several non-profit agencies to consult legal but they are saying they cant help until Santander is suing my mom. She is an honest woman and a victim of what feels like elderly abuse and I am trying my best to help but I do not know what to do next to get them to dismiss 6K of fraud. Any tips would be appreciated!!



UPDATE: WE WON. They dismissed the charges. Got senior office of both MasterCard and Santander involved and from there, it took less than a week for them to remove the fraud charges. Safe to say, persistence paid off in this case! :) ",2024-02-15 02:59:26,0.0,24.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Medical Insurance Denied Claim,"Disclaimer: please be kind; I am trying to navigate this as best I can by myself.

My med insurance company denied a claim for diagnostic lab work in January 2024 even though it is covered under my plan.

When I called to ask why, the insurance rep said she would send it back to the internal claims department for a re-review because it didn't apply to my yearly deductible correctly and in about a month I would receive a call back or an updated EOB. 

I received neither, so I called insurance again and a new rep (because I can't reach the old one since they won't provide direct numbers to specific reps) said it was denied because the billing code was wrong and I would have to talk to the provider to change the code. I mentioned the internal review and she denies there was anything sent to re-review.

I can't reach my provider, and when I can reach the billing 3rd party reps (from the hospital lab where the bloodwork was tested), they are extremely unhelpful to me and my insurance agent. They can freeze the account while I get the issue sorted but only do so for a week at a time. 

I'm stressed about this being sent to collections if I can't get the situation sorted but I don't want to pay hundreds of dollars for something that should easily be covered by my plan. I am nervous if I dispute the claim that the insurance will fall back on that ""billing code is wrong, not our problem"" excuse instead of doing their due diligence and sorting it out with the provider on my behalf. 

It should be noted that last week the most recent insurance rep verbally said she would send out a letter to my provider directly but I don't know if she has yet, have not heard anything from any party involved since, and I don't know if I can even get back to that rep ever again to ask.

I'm fully aware I should have had written communication from the get-go, but I bypassed it in the interest of time and was assuming this wouldn't have escalated into such a big issue. My bad, and I'm now documenting what I can.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can best proceed? ",2024-05-21 16:45:31,2.0,11.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Advice on what to do with old 401k,"I am no longer with the company I worked for, had a 401k with them which has a bit over $800 in it. I am currently experiencing a personal emergency, nothing that qualifies to serve as a relief for tax penalties for cashing out early, but I am trying to be smart about it and not do anything without carefully reviewing my options. 

I am fully aware, cashing out is the worst way to go about it. I would ideally roll it over, but that check would make a world of a difference right now because it will give me enough time to avoid a whole other kind of late payment penalties and headaches until I can sort it out, which I am in the process of doing anyway.

  
What is the worst I can expect during tax season? Made some rough calculations, literally best case scenario, I would likely only make about $30k YTD; so this 401k ""income"" would not push me to a higher earner bracket - or would it? Is there something I am missing? Could I end up owing thousands? I can certainly deal with owing 10% of 800 in taxes, but not if everything I make this year will be taxed differently based on this withdrawal.

Reddit,Sorted,Dealing with the IRS about a fraudulent tax return filed using my/my wife’s information. ,"In 2022 when our CPA filed our tax return we learned that a return had already been filed using our information. This fraudulent return had a significant refund that was paid out to whoever submitted the return. 

When we filed, our return was initially rejected because of the first return, so we had to file by paper and sent a check for the taxes we owed from our own personal return. 

Once the IRS contacted us in late summer 2022, my wife and I filled out the ID theft affidavit and began a process to get things sorted out. The IRS seems to think we owe them upwards of $12k because of how the first fraudulent return was handled.

We’ve received many notices from IRS for balance owed and threats of seizure of assets. I call the IRS to get any information and the representative always tells me that we can ignore the notices as our account is under review.

Our refund for the 2023 tax year was decently sizable (claimed EV tax credit). This refund was sequestered to help offset the balance the IRS thinks we owe.  We aren’t struggling without receiving this refund…but just frustrating that it has been redirected. 

The whole thing has been a mess and there seems to be no one who can provide us any good information. Calling IRS often leads to phone calls that can last an hour or two and depending on the representative can be either decently friendly or pretty aggressive.  But nobody has any concrete information other than our case is under review. 

Anyone here have a similar experience?  Any suggestions?",2024-04-11 01:11:14,6.0,11.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Pension plan - beneficiary,"My dad died Dec 2022 and since my sister lived a lot closer than I she became the administrator of his estate.  Which was pretty messed up as she found active bill accounts in my mother's name, who died in 2018.  And despite knowing he was dying he didn't make a will.

Right after his death she told me that he had a pension plan and they wanted us to fill out paperwork separately.  When I finally got through to the designated representative he said they had been informed by my sister that the estate was being probated (sorry if that's not the right term) so the pension plan would become part of the estate.

During the winter I received a letter from the pension plan looking for my dad's descendants.  I called and said that I had been told since the estate went through probate the pension plan was part of that and by the way why aren't they talking to my sister who is the administrator.  The rep (different one) got all snitty about how they've been calling and mailing.  Yeah, stick that snittiness where the sun doesn't shine.  Life happens.

Now I've received a bunch of documents that include a ""Preferential Affidavit"".  It looks like it's simply wanting my and my sister's information, it has a beneficiary count and beneficiary names/addresses but I'm not that great with legalese.  If I fill this out will it negatively affect my sister?  I don't want her negatively affected.",2024-05-26 02:11:37,0.0,5.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Help me compare 2 job offers - W2 vs 1099,"I currently work full time as a W2 employee in operations. I make $76,500 salary with benefits, PTO, and 401K match.

I was recommended, and then offered, a similar position but it would be a part time 1099 position at $100/hour, which comes to approximately $104,000 if I worked 20 hours every week of the year (which I know is an over estimate when you taking holidays, etc. into account).  
I know I have to set aside at least 15% for self employment taxes, not to mention out of pocket health care. I am married filing jointing, but getting on to my spouses health insurance would actually cost more than enrolling in our marketplace health insurance, which would be about $9k a year. The new job would be a slight career advancement, and less hours. But I'm nervous about being ""Self-employed"" when it comes to taxes, etc. Although I'm not sure if my filing status as married jointly would make it a bit easier/lower tax. I've researched for hours and only seem to end up more confused than when I started (thanks IRS!) So at this point I'm just looking for opinions on either end to see if it helps me make a decision!

Reddit,Sorted,"30-Day Challenge #6: Review your investment asset allocation! (June, 2024)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Review your investment asset allocation!** Some suggestions on how to do this:

* Gather data on your fund selections in each investment account that you have. Include any investment account: IRAs, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans, TSP accounts, taxable brokerage accounts, and so on.
* Figure out what percentage of your overall allocation across accounts is allocated to domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds.
  * You can do this by looking up each fund at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), viewing the fund information on the company website, or just search for the fund name or ticker symbol plus the word ""prospectus"".
  * On [Morningstar Instant X-Ray](https://www.morningstar.com/portfolio.html?requestUrl=/RtPort/Free/InstantXRayDEntry.aspx) (free registration required) or [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio/) (after entering investments, click on the ""Exposures"" tab and scroll to ""Asset Allocation""), you can enter each of your investments and it will return your overall allocation.
  * If you use [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) and have linked your investment accounts, just click on ""Allocation"" under the ""Investing"" menu.
* **Don't panic!** Whatever the result is, the last thing you want to do is change your allocation without doing additional research, reading, and figuring out what you want your overall allocation to be. 

The goal of this exercise is to ensure that you're invested the way you want to be invested. For example, if you want a 20% bond allocation, is that what you have? If you want 35% of your stock investments to be international, are you reasonably close to that? (These are just examples, not recommendations.)

For more information on allocations, here are some recommended readings:

Use the comments to discuss your allocation, any questions you might have, or if you're wondering what you can do about them.

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Check your percentages!**  There are two different challenges this month depending on your position in the [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) list of steps.

1. **If you're on steps 0 through 3, do the first challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Building an emergency fund
  - Paying down expensive debt (interest rate over 10%)

2. **If you're on steps 4 through 6, do the second challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Saving for retirement
  - Investing for other long-term goals

3. **If you're not sure which challenge applies best to you (e.g., not saving for retirement yet, but don't have credit card debt), feel free to pick and choose from either challenge.**

4. **Bonus points: do both challenges!**

# First challenge

Your challenge is to pursue improving your interest rates.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* If you have debts, compile information on each debt including the type of debt, the amount owed, and the interest rate. Also [find out your credit score and review your credit report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%2830-day+challenge+get+on+top+of+your+credit%29&sort=relevance&restrict_sr=on&t=year#res-hide-options)
* If you have credit card debt that you are carrying from month-to-month, [call up your credit card company and make a request to lower your interest rate](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-to-lower-credit-card-interest-rate/).
* If you have enough money in your checking account to cover *at least* one month of expenses, start building a second tier to your emergency fund by opening a savings account and deposit $50 or more into it.
* If you already have a savings account, [research your options](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/) and consider moving your savings account to a bank paying a higher rate.  (The wiki has some [common recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).)

# Second challenge

Your challenge is to audit your investment expenses and emergency fund.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Request a fee schedule/statement from your financial advisor (if you have one).
* Request a fee schedule/statement from the administrator of your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (or find out your fees by logging into your plan account).
* Look through recent statements to see if there are any charges you don't recognize.
* Calculate your [blended expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio).
* Evaluate your emergency fund and adjust it accordingly if your expenses and/or risk tolerance have changed. If you raised it, make a plan to meet your new e-fund goal sometime in the future.

The idea here is that you might uncover some expenses you didn't know you were paying, which in turn might give you a reason to make a change for the better. The impact of [costs on investments can be depressing](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost). If you find a clean slate, sleep well knowing that your money is working for you first and your investment company second. Another way to sleep well is to ensure you have enough set aside for emergencies. You may have set up your emergency fund goal and met it a number of years ago and perhaps times have changed for you. It's a great time to ensure you have an appropriate amount set aside for your expenses and risk tolerance.

Reddit,Sorted,Does this type of financial advisor exist,"I am considering ditching my fee only fiduciary that charges 1.25% for AUM.  Over the past few years I've found my returns on a simple Boglehead 3-fund are inline with what the FA does and I rarely call them for any sort of advice. 

However, I do appreciate the semi annual meeting where they run the Monte Carlo scenario and how my the likely hood of successful retirement (always 100%) and even how adding additional monthly expenses now would impact that.  Other than that comfort, I am not getting much out of the relationship. 

I'd like to find a flat fee advisor that will assist me with transferring assets from my current FA into my personal Schwab account and meet with me once or twice a year to review my personally managed account, make suggestions, and perhaps be able to run retirement simulations for me. 

Is that a thing? Will I be insulting to a FA if I ask to pay them a flat fee to advise on my account? I honestly don't need an advisor at all with this simple 3 fund method but having that extra assurance means a lot to my spouse.

Reddit,Sorted,Can I ask about my simplified budget strategy and get recommendations for account aggregators?,"Hello, 

Basically after totaling all my fixed income and fixed expenses+savings I have $1500 left over. Based on my 2023 analysis, we will spend about $500-600 on groceries per month and $300 on gas for the car. Leaving $600 for everything else.

My ""Misc"" category is big because Mint is gone so I haven't quite been able to break it down. Plus much of it just says ""Amazon"" or ""Venmo"" and its hard to parse. Over the past few years i dove pretty deep into analyzing and over-analyzing my expenses and I've worked out that the best thing for me isn't to review where I'm spending the most or where I can cut back. I save that exercise for the year-end and just get a general sense. 

Anyway, what I'm going to do now instead is just take that $1500 number and put it into YNAB as an ""Inflow"". Then I add an ""Outflow"" transaction. Every week (or when I feel like it), I update that ""Outflow"" value with the sum of all my credit cards, which I pay off on the 15th of each month. This way it sort of carries over the difference (positive or negative...) to the next month as 'bonus' budget. 


My Questions: 

+ How have you guys been managing to break down expenses quickly without Mint?
+ What is a good 'account aggregator'? My only goal is to get a ""spent-so-far"" value with one tap of ""refresh"" but YNAB isn't able to connect all of my accounts, and im not sure it quite does that anyway.
+ What do you think of the $1500 inflow / 1x outflow transaction updated regularly? I think it suits me best, but curious of other opinions.
+ How do you break down your Named Marketplace spends (like venmo/amazon) in a reasonable manner? Since the transaction name doesn't really describe what was purchased.

Reddit,Sorted,Can someone explain LLCs and if I should be starting one?,"Hi everyone, I’m a bit out of my depth on this and could use some advice. 

I am a PhD candidate with research in a relatively niche space - I research trauma-informed care and program utilization decision making processes for people experiencing homelessness. There are not a lot of phds in industry in this space (shockingly there isn’t a lot of money in researching homelessness!). I continued to work in an administrative/leadership position in a homeless shelter while doing my studies so I’ve been fortunate to continuously network while building my expertise. 

All of this matters because I’ve been lucky to advertise my expertise as I’ve done research and have become somewhat well known in my local space and about two years ago partner agencies have started asking me to do trainings, talks, and workshops with their staff on trauma-informed care. At the beginning, I was charging $200 dollars for short talks and it was sort of nothing. The tax implications were incredibly small and it was really just something to go on my CV for my student rankings. 

Slowly my price increased and in the past 6 months it has ballooned up into full on consulting. One organization asked me to put together their new employee orientation to homeless services (3k price point), another asked me to do review and analysis of client surveys they did (1.5k), and most recently I got asked to do a full organizational training and evaluation of trauma informed care (8k) and odds are I’m still undercharging. This is still also doing various smaller classes and workshops for $500 usually sometimes even traveling out of town to other cities for organizations that have heard of me (still n state). One of my mentors recently said I should look at forming an LLC especially cause I have to pay taxes on all of this! 

Only problem - wtf is an LLC? I think I understand it conceptually but how does it impact what I’m doing? Do I pay less taxes? What’s the deal ? Any advice would be appreciated. ",2024-03-30 00:31:36,1.0,2.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,TX non-profit hospital,"Partner was admitted to hospital through ER last night. Pneumonia and hypoxia. On registration to non-profit hospital in Texas, we listed me as domestic partner. We live together, have for 7 months now, but are not common law married, and do not present ourselves as such.

He was laid off in November and will get picked up on my insurance 1/1/24 as my domestic partner.

A registrant for the hospital visited him while I stepped out and brought a packet for financial assistance and was asking about my finances. She asked if we were common law married, he advised we are not, and she asked how long we’ve lived together. When he answered, she said that TX only requires you to live together for 6 months to be considered common law. My understanding is that there are additional requirements, and we have no desire to be common law or recognized as such.

I was reviewing the hospital’s application for financial assistance and they want the income and proof of income and assets for all household members.

While we intend to be married, I am looking for advice on if I am truly required to disclose my information. 

My income will put us over the 200% of poverty threshold that TX uses in their calculation for financial assistance, but certainly isn’t enough to carry a medical debt of this size without reducing costs to insurance rates, and even that will require time to pay.

Reddit,Sorted,Questions regarding FSA limitations & exceptions.,"Heyo, I've got a couple questions regarding FSA funds and how they technically should work, and I've got two main questions about it. I'll try to keep this short but summarizing the main points: 

\- I enrolled into a 2023 FSA for $1200 during my new-hire open enrollment when I joined my new job in October of 2023.

\- I enrolled into a 2024 FSA for the maximum possible $3200.

\- I had a dental procedure done on Saturday, December 30th, which after insurance cost $4250. I used my 2023 FSA funds to cover $1000 of it (the other $200 was spent on misc. stuff), After asking the dental office if they could refund it on January 1st once my new FSA funds became available. They agreed.

\- Fast forward a week or two, and the refund has processed, paid $50 in cash and conveniently the final amount left is exactly $3200, the max eligible FSA amount you can get.

\- I request a receipt from my dental clinic showing proof of the operation and submit it to my FSA manager so they can approve the expense. I was thinking maybe I could use photoshop or some sort of PDF editor to change the date of operation to January 1st in order to get the 2024 FSA fund spending approved, since I've read that all FSA funds can only cover operations that were done in the same calendar year, but it turns out I didn't need to do that. After a week of waiting, the receipt I provided resulted in them approving both the 2023 $1000 FSA charge and the 2024 $3200 FSA charge. All of this leads me to:

&#x200B;

Question one: Are you supposed to be allowed to use next-year funds for dental work, or did someone make a mistake when reviewing and I hugely lucked out?

&#x200B;

Question two: I'm 25, turning 26 later this year, and can use my birthday as a life-event to re-enroll in my elections. Since I was able to alter my FSA contribution amount during open enrollment, could I technically get away with changing my contribution to $0 and not paying back into my FSA for the rest of the year, now that the balance has been spent as a sort of loophole? (assuming it's legal)? I know you can screw your employer out of FSA funds technically if I decided to quit my job right now after having just spent all of my 2024 FSA funds, so it made me curious if life-event enrollment could also be used as a way to take full advantage of funds you don't have to pay for.",2024-02-05 17:11:39,1.0,4.0,personalfinance,Germany,,,,,
Reddit,Sorted,Help/Advice on car loan,"Hello,

So, basically I was hit by a drunk driver in October, and my car was totaled. He was determined at fault and is currently going through legal stuff. My insurance gave me $, part of the money from my insurance paid off the remaining balance of the loan I had

I needed a car fast, sort of felt a little pressured. It may have been stupid but can’t do anything about it now, it’s a good car & I like it, not bad priced considering the car market at the time. It is a 2018 Mazda 3.

What I ended up doing (per idea of a family member) – just put $1,000 down, and the first payment I would make be the rest that WOULD have gone to the down payment. I was planning on putting $10,00.00 down but did not and went with the plan my family member suggested. My first payment was due in December and I put $9,000 straight to principal. I then made a regular payment in January.

My current Loan stats:

Current loan amount: $12,469.99

Monthly payment: $448.64 (60 months loan term)

Interest rate: 8.89%

Next payment due date: April 2, 2024

Loan is through a local credit union.

 

I am looking to lower the monthly payment, credit karma states 669 score but I am aware they are not 100% accurate so it could be higher or lower. My mom is willing to be co-signer (thank the lord for my sweet mother) – pretty sure her credit is good but can 100% check on this to get an approximate.

Saw much about DCU but recent reviews/talk on reddit are seemingly negative.

I would like to add that I have a good record with my previous loan, always paid on time and paid a little more than the minimum payment.

Best credit union rates I can find so far are:

Credit Union #1 – 7.49% (in my mom’s zip code)

Credit union #2 – 7.00% (in my mom’s zip code)

Reddit,Sorted,"Seeking Mint Alternative: Reliable Tracking, Sorting, Categories, and Easy Data Export","Looking for advice on a new expense tracker since Mint is closing.

**Currently:** I use 2 diff Mint accounts: 1 for personal expenses and 1 for my short-term rental income/loss (I just kinda jerry-rig/customize categories). I just connect relevant accounts, review transactions on 1st of each month, and export the data into a spreadsheet for analysis by categories each year.

So I'm literally just tracking personal to see how much I'm spending/on what, which I then compare to my income (which I get from tracking rental income vs expenses in my STR biz acct).

**I don't track investments, loans, debt etc.**, but having them altogether in a separate interface might be convenient (but not a must at all) to just see what I have there. Those include S&P500 in Charles Schwab, old Ethereum in Coinbase, Ally's HYSA, and loans with a credit union, AES, and Navient.

**Key features I need** are reliable tracking without duplicates or missing data, easy sorting/filtering, quality smart + custom categorization, and simple data export.

Don't think I really need goal settings, budgets etc.

* **Smart categorization** \- rules of categories, smart in auto assigning them, as well as a good list of categories/easily customizable.  

* **Easy to add/change** transactions manually, if needed.

Reddit,Sorted,Doctor's error in claim submission leaves me footing the bill...!...?,"I recently had orthotics made by a doctor, one for my right foot and another for my left foot (pretty straightforward, right?). However, it turns out the doctor only submitted the claim for one foot.

Initially, the doctor asked me to pay in advance for the orthotics, assuring me that if they were covered by insurance, I'd receive a reimbursement check from the insurance since I'd paid upfront (this is separate from the specialist visit I did the co-pay).

When I called to inquire about the status of the orthotics, I was informed of the Doctor's mistake since the claim was submitted only for one foot, however, they assured me they were working with the insurance to fix this issue. Despite numerous attempts over months to rectify the situation by contacting their billing department, I was met with no response. When I requested the phone number for the billing department, I was told it was a private/personal number and inaccessible (WTF!), except through the doctor's office. Subsequent calls yielded promises of action that never materialized.

Upon contacting my insurance, I learned that the claim had never been corrected to reflect the claim for both feet. Even more, the claim did not specify I had made the full payment upfront for the orthotics. Consequently, I was told by the insurance I wouldn't receive a reimbursement check. However, the doctor had already received payment from the insurance and from my pocket! (double-dipping? Gotta love the healthcare system!)

After numerous calls and emails providing evidence of the situation, the doctor informed me that adjusting the claim would be considered fraudulent and couldn't be done (I assume because this situaiton could trigger an audit). Instead, the Dr. offered only a partial reimbursement for the upfront payment I made. This outcome not only wasted my time but also unfairly burdened me with the consequences of the doctor's error.

In addition to leaving a negative Google review, I'm considering lodging a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Are there any other avenues I should pursue? Since this doctor was a referral from another practitioner, should I also bring this issue to their attention? Or would it be futile, given the extensive network of doctors involved and potential consequences I coudl receive?

Conspiracy theory would be to think that the Dr. doesn't want to correct this ""issue"" because it beenfits their business with the surplus. Just thinking: how many people forget or don't want to bother with these frustrated situations? I heard this is a sort of common practice with their billing department (at some point I thought the person in charge of their billing department did not even exist)

Loan 2: 7.625% 30 Year 7/1 ARM (rate can fluctuate 2.625-12.625% after 7 years) $1911.04 P&I

Difference in monthly cost: $165.03

Cost to close is $4,246.52 more for loan 2

Is one of these inherently vastly superior to the other?

&#x200B;

\-------

&#x200B;

As for the story...

I'm buying a property which is not eligible for a standard loan (it's a non-warrantable condo in a big city. I looked at a *lot* of places and pretty much none of the condos I would want would be eligible for a standard loan). I was all set to go with loan 1 but I was a little annoyed at the high APR because prior to looking at condos I thought I could get a standard loan and rate but after tons of research, that's just not true for anything I want. Not a big deal in the end, it is what it is.

Realtor calls me the other day and says great news, he found a new lender and the rate will go down almost a full point so I was happy enough with that but didn't think to ask questions (I am in Europe and it was like 1 AM when he called).

I started going through the stuff the new lender was sending me and realized I needed a new appraisal (annoying, but I'm saving so it seems okay). Then I got the disclosures and started to review it. The new loan is an ARM. It's fixed for 7 years but I've always avoided ARMs. I will be selling an investment property in the next 6-12 months (my lender/agent don't know I intend to do this since it's irrelevant) and I have enough equity to pay off this new mortgage, but I'm not sure I want to do that.

I'm sort of unsure if this ""way better"" loan is actually much better at all. Interest rates are high now and *might* go down but if the goal is to refinance in the future, doesn't it make sense to pay less upfront now since it costs money to refinance? The $165.03 I'm saving is offset by the $4246.52 I'm paying upfront and I wouldn't actually be ahead until month 26.

Reddit,Sorted,Windows photos / photo file manager review,"Hi,

I have been running into issues with file explorer and windows photos for years and am going to try some different programs to see if my issues are solved. To Simplify my grading parameters my use case is simple, Import photos (im not critical on this as im mainly looking for something to manage the photos at this point), look into a folder that contains a lot of photos and load the photos, metadata, and thumbnails at a decent time. Be able to sort photos by date taken metadata (Date created unfortunately doesnt mean anything as between iphone and windows random dates are thrown in on this category so it needs to be date taken). Once Im in the folder full of photos and the photos are sorted by date taken I would like to be able to scroll through the photos and copy/cut groups of photos to other folders. When I copy/cut to another folder I would like if there is duplicately named photos that it is copied over regardless with a number added to its name. Thats it just simple photo/file management.

Im just posting this as a draft and will be adding and editing it as I go through, will organize each programs review into bullet points instead of a block of text.

Programs used;  
XnView-  
Started good, ui is like old school file explorer, but immediately ran into issues. You cant open multiple tabs/windows natively without a bug work around so scrolling through a folder and selecting photos to move you have to cut or drag them to the folder tab on the left which is not ideal as you can accidentally choose the wrong folder etc so no ease of access, i used the native move to button and it opens up base level browser search which is super old school was hoping it would atleast open that file location or something. The photos view shows a bunch of data on the bottom of the photo and I only care about the name and date taken and so far have not seen a way to hide all of the other categories. No date taken sort by on meta data only date created which for iphone photos is useless. There is random photos all throughout the layout where the description/tag info is highlighted with a white background so it looks like its selected and is just ugly ui and confusing. I am sorting by (exif date taken since thats the only date taken option) and it seems to be all over the place as theres 2024 photos mixed with 2023 photos and without a way to hide any of the categories shown underneath photos I just have photos with multiple dates listed underneath it. All in all would have been a good app as you can really customize the tool bar but not super strait forward interface. I found a way to choose what labels are shown underneath each photo as well as I believe the EXIF date taken data may be correct if each photo has it, will look to see if date taken is not available if it can sort by date created or something then. I have seen some photos where the date modified is older than the date created so Ill see if the oldest date can be used. So I was able to remove all labels underneath photos so it only shows the name and date taken and that has helped. I have a lot of heic photos without any metadata at all which sucks im sure its a windows photo import issue so that kinda messed things up, im hoping that importing using this program would not have this issue and things go smoothly. Tried the convert image type and it worked fine so dont see any issues with heic support which is a major W over windows photos. Not sure if there is any issues on copy and paste photos with duplicate names yet. Just checked the copy and paste with photos of the same name and it makes you individually rename each one which gets annoying but its easier layout than file explorer. 

adding as I continue

Current issues to be resolved;

1. File explorer struggles with folders with large amounts of photos
2. Thumbnails for photos in file explorer are slow to load or just fails
3. sorting photos by new parameters fails or is slow
4. native sorting system not customizable (this month, earlier this month, last month, earlier this year. not a helpful sorting system at all)
5. Different file types are sorted differently even when a option such as sort by ""date taken"" is selected
6. Copy, cut, paste edits are not reflected in folders and fails
7. Moving photos to another folder that has photos with the same name (stupid iphone naming system) will have multiple photos with the same name and instead of just adding a 1.2.3. to the end automatically it will make you compare and select both photos which is insanely slow.

I believe thats all of the issues I had with file explorer so far will add more as they come up which they will.  
now with the Windows photos app issues I would like a change from;

8. The import photos option fails with iphones that has more than 1000 photos.  
9. Photos app cant recognize all photos on device  
10. Photo import will randomly fail with no option to continue or skip failed files  
11. Import will stay stuck loading for hours.  
12. Photos app fails to recognize previously imported photos sometimes and will just show all as new.",2024-11-26 18:22:44,5.0,2.0,software,Germany,,,,,

This is the second year I've been paying for it. I'm thinking of not renewing next time. I'm paying $120/year.

The UI is nice and it beats all the competitors such as Rescue Time which I had used before. Seeing my monthly and weekly time breakdown loads much faster than Rescue Time, in 10-20 seconds.

The activity log currently has the end of the day first, and as you scroll down, takes you to the beginning. You can't change the sort order to be beginning to end as you scroll down. That's only a few lines of code to implement.

The creators made some ""AI"" insights recently that didn't add much value. I wish they made an integrated to do list that would tell you what the current task is in the overlay bar. They should have built upon existing features instead of trying to go for the AI hype. The software is nice but I can't find any competitors with the same quality as Rize.

Currently we use Microsoft forms to fill out information on a complaint and then take the raw data from excel and create pivot tables(very slowly as we are not very good at it).  The thing is we can't add in pdfs, word docs, photo or video into forms and have an easy way to search when looking for something specific.

The other issue is the boss wants to get away from Microsoft and see what other software is out there.  She would love free software but don't know if that is an option.  The software would have to have good security. 

  
Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.

Hello people, does anyone know an app that I can use to view only certain sections of an app on the monitor? Sometimes I don't have my second monitor and I want to see more than one thing at a time (one above the other), I usually use PowerToys, but for things like watching YT it's not as good because almost the entire section is filled with other things like tabs and so on (like in photo). Any ideas or suggestions of something that will work for that?

Reddit,Sorted,Application for Digital Delivery Notes,"Hey, I've been searching for a few weeks for an application that can create digital delivery notes while in the field for a medium sized organization. I've found a couple potential candidates, but they all have some sort of major limitation. Can anyone recommend alternative options?

  
What I've tried so far:

* deliverynotes.net- good design with 'admin' and 'user' permissions, but is limited in customizability of the layout of the document. Also only allows one signature per delivery note. We need both customer and driver signature.

* Zoho forms- good customizability of document layout. Reviewing data in real-time not possible. Will have to create an excel dump of the data each time. Searching for past documents will aslo need work-arounds.",2024-07-02 10:41:06,1.0,0.0,software,Germany,,,,,

I then installed the app on my phone tho I don’t really want a dedicated app on my phone for something i do once a year. Here it was clear what my bill was, i clicked to pay, chose my bank, it took me to my bank app and i chose the account and then it redirected me to some third party thing called ecopay that just hung for 10-15 mins. I eventually reloaded and went through the payment again with the same result but then when I eventually reloaded it said “paid”.

The questions in the app seemed clear and easy to follow with one notable exception. The total earnings figure is automatically generated from my P60. Fine, but there is nowhere to input allowable deductions such as allowable pension contributions and uniform maintenance allowance. Having worked my way round the questions several times in a loop I reasoned the only way to report these deductions was to amend the P60 figure, despite the online form confusingly stating that this field was for the earnings figure BEFORE deductions. There is NOWHERE ELSE to input any other earnings figure.

My only gripe about how the name/company system works (maybe i've worked it out wrong) but I want to be able to assign multiple people to the same organisation as I get work from different people within larger companies and to be able to see the individuals names listed when I am creating the invoice. Currently, I might have 'client 1 name' in one field and their company in the company field. But when i go to make a new invoice, it lists every 'client' under the same company name - so the list looks like:

Create invoice for:
Smithsons steel works
Smithsons steel works
Smithsons steel works

It doesn't list the name of each client. So i end up making a new invoice, going to the preview of the invoice and checking I got the right person, navigating back and changing via guess until it's correct. I did start putting individuals names in brackets next to the company but then it looks bad on the invoice, which would read like:

Pauline bobson
Smithson steel works (Pauline Bobson)
79 down the lane
New turkeyville
LE45 9TT

Just ends up looking bad. 

Its the only minor inconvenience! I love the overall ease for making quick invoices on the go!

The app though is another story. 

It seems I have misinterpreted the repeated marketing communications we have received recently that a new “replatformed” app was on its way. I assumed this meant one that was much more user friendly and more fully featured. I was wrong. From my perspective the new app is the same as the old and I didn’t get on well with that. 

I regularly find myself having to revert to the website for key basic information such as how much is currently owed on various projects. Adding things like mileage takes a couple of goes for it to “stick” and can we please set a minimum increment when time tracking as scrolling by the minute is tedious. The design is very different from the website but not in a helpful way so information is buried. 

I would suggest instead just using the mobile website as generally that is significantly better, but the problem is that the mobile site is only mobile on some pages and not others so you constantly switch between full size and mobile suitable.

Hence about 95% of the time I’m using this mobile app to capture receipts.

The capturing and cropoing process is probably the worst I’ve used in any app - period.

If I have an existing image of a receipt and capture it, the app often decides that half of it needs to be cropped out by default - the ‘automatic’ cropping is just universally bad at doing this.

When I then try to fix the automatically cropped image, the method used for moving the corner handles is just dire. Why you can’t adopt the standard method of dragging the sides of images I don’t know… and having the handles ‘stick’ when they touch the sides is painful. It’s just an awful way to crop images quickly and easily. Crop / rotate images using the usual tools / methods - don’t reinvent something (badly) that just infuriates users.

Please fix the image cropping. At the very least just default to never auto-cropping initially (provide a button for it if anyone really wants you to screw it up for them) and I’ll use iOS photos app to do the cropping properly.

You should then be able to create a new expense in the app, select ""Cash"" as the payment type, and then assign it to the cash account you just created. Though the app only allows you to upload one receipt per transaction, there is a method you can use to upload additional photos to QuickBooks. To do so, open the ""Notes & Attachments"" menu, create a new note (including info about the receipt you\'re scanning), tap the Attach (Paperclip) icon in the top-right corner, and snap a photo of the reverse side of your receipt. From there, you\'ll be able to access the file via the QBO site (Gear icon > ""Attachments"") and attach it to the appropriate transaction.

Sage seems to have a few issues. 

Please correct me if I am wrong but adding a new customer you are force to put something in the business name as well as the personal name. Which make no sense. Must of my clients are public. 

You also have to put the clients address which you don’t with the other apps. 

With Just a simple location button. One press and the address is automatically input. 

There is also a problem adding a product with the vat. 

If you click the inclusive vat it still sets it as exclusive. 

So you have to know the price less vat every time you make a new item so unless your jobs are set prices you need to calculate the vat and add the net price. 

Clearly has a long way to go before being ahead of the others.

Cons

Sage seems to have a few issues. 

Please correct me if I am wrong but adding a new customer you are force to put something in the business name as well as the personal name. Which make no sense. Must of my clients are public. 

You also have to put the clients address which you don’t with the other apps. 

With Just a simple location button. One press and the address is automatically input. 

There is also a problem adding a product with the vat. 

If you click the inclusive vat it still sets it as exclusive. 

So you have to know the price less vat every time you make a new item so unless your jobs are set prices you need to calculate the vat and add the net price.

Thirdly when they eventually realised the seriousness of the problem they deployed the correct people who then promised to rectify the problem within a series of timescales, all of which were extended time after time.

Bugs such as the option to view either “Reviewed” or “unreviewed” milage, randomly wont function until the second time the milage tab is accessed after opening the app.  Another example of app instability is its annoying habit of signing you out at random intervals and needlessly requesting fingerprint scans when swiping between apps.

Hence about 95% of the time I’m using this mobile app to capture receipts.

The capturing and cropoing process is probably the worst I’ve used in any app - period.

If I have an existing image of a receipt and capture it, the app often decides that half of it needs to be cropped out by default - the ‘automatic’ cropping is just universally bad at doing this.

When I then try to fix the automatically cropped image, the method used for moving the corner handles is just dire. Why you can’t adopt the standard method of dragging the sides of images I don’t know… and having the handles ‘stick’ when they touch the sides is painful. It’s just an awful way to crop images quickly and easily. Crop / rotate images using the usual tools / methods - don’t reinvent something (badly) that just infuriates users.

Please fix the image cropping. At the very least just default to never auto-cropping initially (provide a button for it if anyone really wants you to screw it up for them) and I’ll use iOS photos app to do the cropping properly.

I don’t usually write reviews - but this has been annoying me for years and it’s totally fixable.",3.0,False,Shadenville

You should then be able to create a new expense in the app, select ""Cash"" as the payment type, and then assign it to the cash account you just created. Though the app only allows you to upload one receipt per transaction, there is a method you can use to upload additional photos to QuickBooks. To do so, open the ""Notes & Attachments"" menu, create a new note (including info about the receipt you\'re scanning), tap the Attach (Paperclip) icon in the top-right corner, and snap a photo of the reverse side of your receipt. From there, you\'ll be able to access the file via the QBO site (Gear icon > ""Attachments"") and attach it to the appropriate transaction.

My only gripe about how the name/company system works (maybe i've worked it out wrong) but I want to be able to assign multiple people to the same organisation as I get work from different people within larger companies and to be able to see the individuals names listed when I am creating the invoice. Currently, I might have 'client 1 name' in one field and their company in the company field. But when i go to make a new invoice, it lists every 'client' under the same company name - so the list looks like:

Create invoice for:
Smithsons steel works
Smithsons steel works
Smithsons steel works

It doesn't list the name of each client. So i end up making a new invoice, going to the preview of the invoice and checking I got the right person, navigating back and changing via guess until it's correct.

Pauline bobson

It seems I have misinterpreted the repeated marketing communications we have received recently that a new “replatformed” app was on its way. I assumed this meant one that was much more user friendly and more fully featured. I was wrong. From my perspective the new app is the same as the old and I didn’t get on well with that. 

I regularly find myself having to revert to the website for key basic information such as how much is currently owed on various projects. Adding things like mileage takes a couple of goes for it to “stick” and can we please set a minimum increment when time tracking as scrolling by the minute is tedious. The design is very different from the website but not in a helpful way so information is buried. 

I would suggest instead just using the mobile website as generally that is significantly better, but the problem is that the mobile site is only mobile on some pages and not others so you constantly switch between full size and mobile suitable.

Si bien, el servicio de atención al usuario deja mucho que desear. Mi pareja y yo tuvimos que contactar con soporte para resolver una duda que nos surgió durante la generación del borrador y fue un mareo constante. 
Primero tratas de hablar con ellos por el chat de la aplicación, que sirve de poco o nada, ya que te instan a mandar tus dudas al correo de soporte que tienen. A las dudas planteadas por correo, nos respondían una y otra vez con respuestas generadas de forma automática donde, de nuevo, nos instaban a hablar por el chat de la aplicación (y a comprar un plan superior, ¡cómo no!).

El problema parecía residir en que, al contactar por correo, no eran capaces de identificarnos como clientes de la aplicación porque nos habíamos registrado con Apple ID (de manera que se les oculta nuestro correo y parece ser que tratan de vincular tus solicitudes mediante el correo con el que te registras. Al ocultarse nuestro correo, no son capaces de identificarte y se van pasando la bola unos a otros entre el chat y el correo de soporte). Con lo sencillo que hubiera sido que trasladaran directamente la incidencia planteada en el chat a los asesores correspondientes… 

Pd: Mi pareja contrató el plan en el que tienes un asesor directamente vía chat, y aun así todas las dudas planteadas le indicaban que las enviara por correo, no sé para qué sirve ese plan entonces…",3.0,False,arg1512

Primero tratas de hablar con ellos por el chat de la aplicación, que sirve de poco o nada, ya que te instan a mandar tus dudas al correo de soporte que tienen. A las dudas planteadas por correo, nos respondían una y otra vez con respuestas generadas de forma automática donde, de nuevo, nos instaban a hablar por el chat de la aplicación (y a comprar un plan superior, ¡cómo no!).

El problema parecía residir en que, al contactar por correo, no eran capaces de identificarnos como clientes de la aplicación porque nos habíamos registrado con Apple ID (de manera que se les oculta nuestro correo y parece ser que tratan de vincular tus solicitudes mediante el correo con el que te registras. Al ocultarse nuestro correo, no son capaces de identificarte y se van pasando la bola unos a otros entre el chat y el correo de soporte). Con lo sencillo que hubiera sido que trasladaran directamente la incidencia planteada en el chat a los asesores correspondientes…

Al ocultarse nuestro correo, no son capaces de identificarte y se van pasando la bola unos a otros entre el chat y el correo de soporte).

Esta aplicación responde a la típica startup salen vendiendo la luna y no llegan, falla más que una escopeta de feria.

Imposible llevar control por centro de coste, criterios personales de informatico que llevan a tener distinta numeración en los asientos del diario y del mayor … no hay criterio.

La conexión bancaria dependiendo que que banco funciona o no, requiriendo reconexiones continuas, los asientos automáticos generan errores no vinculando pagos a facturas, no hay forma de personalizar u obtener listados, … llevar una contabilidad se hace difícil hasta límites insospechados.

El reconocimiento de facturas funciona, pero el proceso, si el proveedor es nuevo, implica trabajo manual, hay problemas con factura multipagina, hay que revisar que haga bien el desglose en IVA por ejemplo en facturas electricidad y agua con varios tipos que además han cambiado últimamente, etc… es de lo poco bueno que tiene.

No eres capaz de copiar asientos, como mucho predefinidos, pero es un coñazo, tareas sencillas como copiar el asiento de una nómina del mes pasado o dejar un asiento a medias por que te vas a comer, son imposibles.

Por otro lado el chat de soporte 2 veces que lo contacté te derivan a una conversación por correo, mucho menos resolutiva…).
La app la tengo de hace unas semanas y así de primeras no se veía tan bien organizada (UX/UI) como en la web y hoy ya me acaba de dar un problema (en una nota extensa en un proyecto de “Reuniones” cuando la abro, no me deja cerrarla si no cambio de pestaña en el menú inferior; para notas más cortas sí. Un error de interfaz responsive o de funcionalidad [será que las notas no las consideran para hacerlas extensas, sin avisar de ello], supongo que es la primera, un error de interfaz).

We uploaded every document and chose to be assisted by a specialist. We were assigned to Nigel, who was amazing and assisted us wonderfully. After almost three hours, he told us that management is reviewing our file and he’ll call us back the next working day to complete the process.

The first thing he said when he called us back was that he didn’t have good news; management had decided to deny us the service for being non-resident aliens (which is not even the case) and filing for the first time. I was so confused I wanted to make sure I got that right, so I repeated what he said back as a question: they are denying us the service for being immigrants, and for this being our first time filing? His answer: yes, that’s basically why. I then asked if there was a way around it, someone we could talk to; he said no way around it and no one to talk to since the decision came from management.

For people who didn’t grow up here, the tax system/process can be overwhelming, especially the first time. Taking that into consideration, do you think it’s fair, or even logical, for TurboTax to deny assisting us just because we are immigrants, and this being our first time?

The app was relatively easy to use, but it did get old going in circles sometimes. Unfortunately, the free option really is not usable. If you have to file state taxes like just about everyone, then you will have to pay $40 per state. If you’re a college student in another state like me, that means two states so $80. Of course, no student discount. Honestly, that was not too bad since I was supposed to get a lot back.
Unfortunately, that was not what happened. I did get some from one the state returns, but that was it. The IRS sent a letter for a health insurance form that didn’t even apply to me. If you want help with that, guess what? It will cost you even more money! At that point, I wasn’t paying TurboTax any more so I went off on my own. Eventually I got it figured out, but not without massive disruption to my school work. None of that help was thanks to TurboTax which sends you to FAQs that don’t really apply.
They have online discussions which appear to have many people with the same problem. This program is made to look easy- and it is at first- but the headache it causes later is not worth it. Never had trouble like this with H&R Block so I think I’ll go back to them next year. Whatever you do, don’t use TurboTax. It is seriously not worth it.

This year is the last year I’ll ever use it. If you you haven’t done your 2021 taxes yet and are considering TurboTax, don’t. This year, the great people at TurboTax decided to have you manually choose the “free” option not once, not twice, but three separate times. If you select “free” the first two time times and don’t catch the third, well guess what? You now owe TurboTax $120. That’s right even after selecting “free” multiple times, they select their pro package by default whenever they ask for the third or fourth time. I would not recommend this app nor recommend doing your taxes with TurboTax. Their shady practices, unnecessary bombardment of asking what package you want multiple times AFTER selecting, and automatically setting YOUR choice to their upgraded package are just horrible, opportunistic actions. I will never use TurboTax again and will tell everyone I know exactly why they shouldn’t either.

It said it was only $49 so I didn’t mind.

My first time using TurboTax was fairly positive.  The interface was easy to use and there was a lot of helpful tips and references that made it feasible to navigate filing completely on your own.  There was a lot of good validation and built in checks that caught things or made suggestions before I submitted my filings.  I was especially impressed with how quickly my returns were accepted and processed, which was very reassuring.

My only negative comment which is why I’m giving four instead of five reviews is that I noticed during certain times the mobile app would struggle to connect and display a blank screen.  The first time this happened I was frustrated and posted a negative review.  Thankfully, I found that I was able to continue by logging in on the website version, which had retained everything I previously entered. Since this software is so widely used, development might want to look at the load capacity of syncing data with the mobile app, as I’m assuming this was part of the problem during night traffic times of day.

It’s been a year and I haven’t got my money I talked to a lady on the phone with a really bad attitude who told me I’d never get a refund for anything and the IRS is backed up and it’s ok that I haven’t got money in a year.

TurboTax was easy, and Faster didn’t ask a bunch of stupid questions only what is necessary, it looked as from a developers stand point that they put much more effort into a modern application with TurboTax they don’t Spam you with upgrading, AND they seem to have more features! 

The mobile app is nice also but isn’t much more than added bio-metric support (Touch ID). They should have better design for the app but that’s only as a developer opinion it works fine just its one of those things lol.

So I went ahead and tired to change it to E-File and I had to pay in total of $150 to change that option. And I’m not okay with that only because when I filed it was free. I would understand $30-$60.

1- if you’ve filed on-line before and you’re taxes are simple to a little less simple, H&R is all you need. They ask important questions to make sure you have the right forms and they make it easy to ask questions or to get a definition. The other competitor asked pretty much all questions. One question at a time. Name? Type and confirm. Address. Type and confirm. Over and over agin. H&R provides it in fill-out form which takes A LOT less time. 

2- the only “special” part of my taxes are student loans. And the other competitor does not supply the form to file for free, hence $25 for one form and all these add-one that I don’t want or need. A form that is still free on H&R.

Edit:  someone at CreditKarma must have read my review, because they finally got a sensible update note instead of the one promising they had now added that same thing they now added last time and many times before that.

I just paid the remaining balance and cut up the card! 

First of all this card doesn’t even show up on your credit as a credit card but as a personal loan so if you are hoping that getting card will increase your available credit it won’t. Secondly, they will reduce the amount you can use without notice even if you have never been late on a payment. I have never missed a payment, been late on a payment or even paid just the minimum payment and they reduced my available loan amount just because I had a major hit on my credit score for something that was beyond my control. Then later suspended my card all together while I still had over $1700 in available credit and my balance was less than 25% of my available credit.

Immediately contacting them during the scam, they were very proactive about making sure it was me, what my phone number and email should be on my account, and then locked my account and closed all physical and digital cards. About 2 business days later, they completed their investigation and returned my funds.
This was my first time dealing with fraud with them and I feel very confident and protected with the support they gave.
I feel compelled to write this for others who undecided on investing through them with their high interest yeilding savings account and will always recommend it to anyone.

App Store,Credit Karma Tax,Feature reduction from Mint,,2023-12-26 23:15:36,,,,us,,"Recently, Intuit's decision to transition Mint users to Credit Karma has proven to be a difficult process. The shift comes with significant drawbacks, including the lack of integration for commonly used credit cards, which was a staple in Mint. Additionally, the customization options for managing assets and budgets in Credit Karma are noticeably less robust compared to Mint's features, reducing the overall user experience.

One of the most troubling aspects of this transition is its irreversibility. Once users migrate to Credit Karma, they lose the ability to access or use Mint, even if they prefer its interface and functionality. This enforced switch, without the option to revert, demonstrates a lack of consideration for user preference and flexibility.

The changeover has been a major disappointment for long-time Mint users. The new platform doesn't just fall short in matching Mint's capabilities; it also removes a level of control and familiarity that many had come to appreciate. The hope is that Intuit will recognize these shortcomings and make rapid improvements to Credit Karma, addressing the specific needs and concerns of its user base to restore the high standard of service previously enjoyed with Mint.",1.0,False,PMTSDoc

The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because I just bought a used car a few weeks ago thinking my Transunion score was 701 and my Equifax score 715 due to what CK was showing. However the salesman came back and showed my score to be around 660 (might’ve been 657 exactly from Equifax if I remember right), so the deal wasn’t as good as I had hoped for. 

So I asked the manager why this was and he said he gets this question all the time and he told me it’s because CK uses “older” / faulty algorithms that aren’t fully up to date, resulting in scores that are higher than what they truly are. I still bought the car, although I wish I would’ve waited a little longer for my actual scores to hit 700+ resulting in lower interest rates.

If it weren’t for this rather large discrepancy between CK scores and actual scores, this would be a 5 star app easily.

It’s not generally going to be the same score as you would get from those sites directly. Sadly, worse than that is the EX issue. My FICO is completely different than my scores on CK (Again, because they have their own scoring model). I get that Experian has their own credit products and that’s probably why they don’t share their data with CK. However, CK should really negotiate a way to include EX scores to provide a better snapshot of where on truly is. I’ve applied for numerous cards on here that said I had good or very good approval chances, like everyone else, but got denied because the lender only cares about FICO. Yet other times I got approved for cards where I had poor odds lol.

I do have one issue - and I do NOT think it’s related to CreditKarma but I’ll put it here.  I pay off my credit cards fully each month.  And I use one specific card.  Another card had a promotion for the last two months so I began to use the other card.  The credit companies noted this as a increase in the one card but didn’t note that my other card purchase were lowered for this time frame.  This caused my excellent credit rating to drop 50 points.

it needs to be re-created and then entered a second (twice) time for verification.

As for their bank account, two of my banks are major banks. I cannot connect this to them because they come back with errors. The banks verification system doesn't like credit karma. Also doesn't like truebill and one or two other apps.

First time using them. They took a month to match me to an agent which is fine it’s off season and she was great the issue is with the app and online site. I had to sign to file but when you agree to “docusign” it takes you to a form you have to download and sign then upload back to the agent. I don’t know how they thought that was supposed to worn on the iPhone but it doesn’t it shows the document and then doesn’t have a download button so it can imported into any other app or even a share button to import into any other app. There was no back button so I had to force close the app and when I reopen it it’s asking for another payment before I can try to get the documents again. I tried on a computer and the same thing. It wants a payment to see the documents you’re supposed to sign. Besides them asking for payment again after giving me the receipt the first time docusign is supposed to be a lot easier. On the PC they give two signing options that lead you to the same file to download. And to top off the frustration I have to sign into the app every time I open it and it won’t save the password into apple passwords and when I try to view my account to see if there is a Face ID option the page never loads.

So, step one, completing the taxes works; but again, of course it does. It’s math. 

But I paid for the “have a tax expert review your taxes” as again I’m neurotic and just wanted that piece of mind. I had two questions: one a bit complicated due to the state issue and the other was very basic. Both times I emailed my “advisor” through the app and both times waited three full days for a response.

Not all is bad as my return did double in amount but when advertised and I switched for that one reason, I expect them to live up to what they advertised. So I started filling out my taxes and the advertisement said at the end of my tax preparation I would be able to fill out for the return advance so I finish filling out my taxes and then filed but was never asked if I wanted to try for the advance. So the next day I called to see why which they couldn’t give an explanation and even thought I opted to have my return put on their Emerald card they couldn’t change anything which also meant I couldn’t apply for the refund advance. Even though they own the financial company that actually give the advances and I had it put on one of their cards which completely baffled me.

Last year I filed with hr block and was erroneously credited a refund of $3000, hr block made a mistake and I actually owed $190. Ok fine, I paid the state tax with much difficulty. The next year I decided to use hr block again mainly because they already had my information and it was easy. Now in the middle of closing for a house my mortgage loan Officer is saying that my taxes that I filed and printed 3 months ago are not filed and state taxes are not paid. The third party website has not paid my taxes 3 months later and when I try to call the phone number for the third party payment company I get nothing but adds for direct tv and oil changes. Then after 6 minutes of that they say that their phone number has changed. So I have now paid state taxes twice ($1876) along with paying over $3500 initially for $3355 in actual tax liability. At this point I have paid $4465 to pay $3355 in tax liability. And it is my responsibility to try to get my money back from the third party where you can not actually talk to a live person. This is a scam I will never use hr block again.",1.0,False,Sue12345!

1- if you’ve filed on-line before and you’re taxes are simple to a little less simple, H&R is all you need. They ask important questions to make sure you have the right forms and they make it easy to ask questions or to get a definition. The other competitor asked pretty much all questions. One question at a time. Name? Type and confirm. Address. Type and confirm. Over and over agin. H&R provides it in fill-out form which takes A LOT less time. 

2- the only “special” part of my taxes are student loans. And the other competitor does not supply the form to file for free, hence $25 for one form and all these add-one that I don’t want or need. A form that is still free on H&R.
